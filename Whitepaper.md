## A world without energy and water scarcity.

*Mpowa and its associates envision a future on earth where sufficient resources are, and ultimately abundance is, realized and accessible for all.* 

### Preface

This blockchain-based interactive SaaS platform, 
is contrived to stimulate society to collectively ensure global resource sufficiency and accessibility for sustainable healthy living. 
Aiming to serve humanity as a whole, on the increasingly more turbulent and polluted planet earth. 
Averting unnecessary illness and death is the most important reason for Mpowa’s existence,
as every human being should ideally be able to live in a healthy way. 
By continually increasing the Energy Flux Density, resource abundance is within reach. 
Mpowa does not agree to the general consensus of mandatory vaccination and consumption control in order to reduce emissions. 

By also empowering externally organized SDG-oriented[^1] clean-tech projects to present themselves on the platform,
Mpowa facilitates the industry with a high-standard GTM opportunity, 
while also permitting low-cap / high-value projects to raise the necessary funding to succeed.
Transparency and auditability are key features of blockchain technology, 
which provide traceability of funds (resource allocation can be tracked from start to finish) and verifiable Proof of Impact.
Constant transparency and credibility also differentiates the SaaS platform from established competitors and well known large-scale 
foundations that utilize traditional banking technology. 
Mpowa’s data-driven approach is in line with UN’s DSDs to match the United Nations National Quality Assurance Frameworks Manual for Official Statistics. 
By utilizing blockchain technology, 
Mpowa provides an additional credibility layer to ensure data quality, transparency of set definitions and important terms and 
project methodology towards contributors and auditors.

## Introduction

This introduction will entail Mpowa’s core purpose, its SaaS-platform functionality with the appurtenant financial flow, 
alongside complementary information such as strategic goals, partnerships (consortium) and research data.
Written to inform the readers about the company and the complementary DAO, 
in order to increase the readers’ knowledge and create a valuable risk-assessment. 
MPOWA Ltd is exclusively a technology company, with all financial activity provided by third parties. 
MPOWA Ltd is not controlled or owned by any other organization which provides financial services. 
	The future of (cash) money will predominantly be digital, hence Mpowa’s choice of utilizing blockchain technology. 
Global adoption of blockchain technology to gain financial sovereignty through tokens, 
tokenized assets and DeFi applications is increasing at a fast pace. Also notable are the upcoming central bank digital currencies (CDBC), 
after many years of resistance. 
	As the regulatory and technological maturity levels stabilize globally in preparation for the mass adoption of these new digital technologies,
Mpowa is planning to develop and launch a suite of digital tokens covering three major use cases: investment, data and payments. 
Each token is designed to address specific aspects of the NetZero transition to a sustainable circular economy, 
with the investment and data tokens working in tandem to provide end-to-end traceability of ESG investment flows from 
external funds through to the underlying economy as measured physically via IoT sensors and consecutively reported through defined SDG parameters. 
	Additionally, Mpowa’s goal is to launch an ISO20022 compliant zero carbon payment token for energy generation and 
consumption in Q3 of 2022, minted and mined on a global and distributed trustless network of interconnected Zero-Emission crypto-mining devices. 
This is realized through partnerships with Energy Web Foundation Crypto Climate Accord and Steroid 4.0 blockchain, amongst others.    

Transparency and auditability are key features of blockchain technology, which provide traceability of funds (resource allocation) and 
verifiable Proof of Impact. Through monitoring and verifying project-data on the blockchain, 
Mpowa initiates a global quality standard for the issuance of (Tokenized) Carbon Offset Credits, 
preventing double-selling and realizing real-time / direct offset. Customers won’t be purchasing project-approximation credits, 
but merely verified and realized tokenized Carbon Offset Credits. By creating the platform, Mpowa facilitates the clean-tech industry with
a high-standard GTM opportunity, while also permitting low-cap / high-value projects to raise the necessary funding to succeed.
	
Through acquisition and spending of Mpowa’s Utility Token the users’ contributions will be submitted to project-fund pools, 
from which the designated parties will receive their share according to the product or service that is or will be delivered, 
in order to start or complete a project. Depending on the amount that is being contributed or the type of contribution, 
the user may receive an additional SDG Impact Token or a Non-Fungible Token (a certificate linking to the products that they’ve purchased for a 
beneficiary family). For certain projects, Tokenized Carbon Offset Credits will be distributed once the offset is realized. Data Tokens and 
Data-Logging Tokens are interlinked to specific NFT’s that facilitate the offset. These various ways of contributing to listed projects, 
are more thoroughly described in the sections ‘’The Platform’’ and ‘’Tokenomics’’. 
	Project-fund pools are better formulated as smart-contracts, which are financial software-programs that are continuously running on 
the blockchain, once deployed. This will be further elucidated in the chapter ‘’The Technology’’.	All contributions will be acquired from 
verified platform-users, which have successfully submitted their necessary information through the implemented KYC-protocol, 
in order to ensure an entirely legitimate stack of contributions to ensure regulatory compliance. Mpowa has a strict and correct privacy policy 
to ensure safety of their users’ data. Not all data will be stored on the blockchain, yet shall be encrypted to prevent data-theft.	
Most contributions, with presumably different financial values, will have unique and fair voting properties carried with it, 
concerning projects and questions that are presented by the Mpowa-DAO. After purchase, these voting rights will become available for the contributor, 
through Governance Tokens. These project specific voting rights will be different for every project and every donation, 
carrying different properties that will be clearly described in the receipt before the users confirm their project-contribution. 
Read more about these voting properties in the chapter “DAO’’. Please note that the voting rights / Governance Tokens that may be granted 
to the contributor from acquiring a token or tokens only applies to matters/projects concerning the DAO and are not equal to possessing equity 
or shareholder-rights in the company, Mpowa Ltd, itself.

For a detailed disclaimer on token purchases, please read the chapter ‘’Disclaimer’’ and consult the additional documents available on the 
Mpowa website, or the documents provided by the approved exchanges that have listed Mpowa’s tokens.	
There are various methods to acquire the tokens that are issued by Mpowa, all which are described in the chapter ‘’Tokenomics’’. 
Every contributor should consult with independent tax advisors as to the consequences of receiving the Mpowa Token(s). 	
It is anticipated that the value of the token(s) will fluctuate over time, except the Mpowa Utility Token (stablecoin) - which is 1:1 
pegged with the Euro fiat currency. After delivery, the value of the tokens may be determined based on current pricing on third-party exchanges, 
and in the absence of such pricing, the price of the tokens may be limited to what a buyer is willing to pay in a privately negotiated arms-length 
transaction. The company is not under any obligation to provide token valuations to purchasers and provides no guarantees that it will 
take affirmative steps to facilitate a secondary market for the tokens. There can be no guarantee that the tokens will hold their value or 
increase in value. Many factors will influence this outcome, including increased activity on the blockchain, demand for the blockchain’s 
services as blockchain projects proliferate, and other factors that are outside of the company’s control.

The first token we are launching is the Mpowa Utility Token (stablecoin for project contributions), followed by a security token, 
the Mpowa SDG Impact Token - linked to the Mpowa Carbon Fund. This is an investment grade digital financial asset that is fully regulatory 
compliant and linked to our Luxembourg domiciled AIFM ESG fund launched in partnership with Scaling Funds. The Mpowa Utility Tokens are used 
in the Decarbonizer.app and the Decarbonizer Pro services to fund projects via the platform and provide complete traceability of funds from 
investors to impact via the blockchain. Depending on the project and contribution size, a certain amount of Mpowa SDG Impact 
Tokens will be transferred to the contributor.	All Mpowa Tokens can used by enterprises, NGOs, charities and consumers to support 
ESG-related energy and water projects in line with 17 SDGs. The SDG Impact Tokens and Tokenized Carbon Credits are minted dynamically, 
according to the projects capacity.
The cryptocurrencies created by Mpowa are among the first (crypto)currencies to be born as carbon negative, climate positive. 
Users of the Mpowa platform can potentially utilize their contributions in a way to reduce their tax bill.		
An additional token, the Mpowa Energy Coin, will be issued in late Q2 or Q3 of 2022. This currency will be created and used on the 
Steroid 4.0 blockchain network, which guarantees regulatory approval, scalability, and security. Proof of Green is provided by the 
Energy Web Foundation CCA Protocol. Tokens will be minted and mined on the global Mpowa HPC network with our first site likely being in RSA or Cyprus. 
	The ESG Fund is where all fiat contributions are held - whether from investors in the overall company fund, or project specific treasuries. 
This fund is controlled by our partner, Scaling Funds, with full FATCA and CRS compliance.




## Vision

Mpowa and its associates envision a future on earth where sufficient resources and ultimately abundance is realized and accessible for all. 
With sufficient resources, we refer to basic components for human life (not to be considered as luxuries) such as clean drinking water, 
sustainably farmed organic food, medical supplies, education, shelter and zero-emission energy / clean mobility. 
Clean water is a key-component for maintaining overall public health, whether it is used for drinking, domestic use, 
food production or recreational purposes. Improved clean-water supply and sanitation, and better management of water resources, 
can boost countries’ economic growth and can contribute greatly to poverty reduction, hence the focus on distributing water purification devices 
during the pilot projects.
The future of power generation is 100% sustainable and maintenance free.
 We believe everybody should have access to an abundant source of clean, carbon-neutral energy. 
Mpowa will contribute to the decentralization of power generation and return the power back to the people. 
Mpowa will create the first self-powering, carbon-neutral blockchain- based energy grid, based upon a global network of autonomous 
self-powering generator devices.
The overall vision of Mpowa is a world of connected fully autonomous devices of various type which produce and consume their own energy,
 in some cases selling the surplus back to the grid (where local regulations and infrastructure permit), 
all registered with Energy Web Chain for unique identification of the device, whilst metered and paid for in Mpowa cryptocurrency tokens.
Having achieved global mass adoption of our device and blockchain infrastructure, by definition, 
our utility token will in effect become a global digital “fully fungible energy based unit of account” currency (stablecoin) that can potentially be used as the international medium of exchange between national currencies – because energy consumption is the absolute holy grail indicator of economic activity and hence pure gold dust as far as economists and central bankers trying to define monetary and credit policy for their economies goes. This aligns well to the emerging trend of increased use of blockchain and AI within the financial sector for purposes of oversight and automation of the financial system and national currencies. Sustainability is defined as the process of mankind's action to avoid the depletion of natural resources, to maintain the ecological balance and not to allow the quality of life to decline in today's modern society. A measure that does slightly less damage to the natural world, in the belief that ecosystems not only ensure that they continue to function and create the conditions that allow quality of life in modern society not to decline, but also to claim to be sustainable. Given the environmental and social problems faced by societies around the world, sustainability can be exploited in a specific way. 	Sustainability encourages people, politicians and businesses to make long-term decisions and take future generations into account. It encourages companies to make decisions about environmental, social and human impacts in the long term, rather than short-term profits. Sustainable development is the process of social progress that takes into account the needs of current and future generations by integrating economic, social and environmental considerations into decision-making.	Companies that achieve corporate sustainability must reduce their emissions, reduce their energy consumption, source products from fair trade organizations, and ensure that their physical waste is disposed of with the lowest possible carbon footprint. Companies can make a public commitment to sustainability through measures such as waste reduction, investments in renewable energies and support organizations that offset carbon emissions. Even when big brands are committed to sustainability, it can take a long time to achieve sustainability goals, hence the creation of the carbon offset market to reach net-zero prior to demanding instant technological replacements to stop emissions. 















## Mission

Our long-term mission is to catalyze the mass adoption of new forms of clean sustainable energy and utilize the benefits of these technologies in best interest of the end-user. This is achieved by supporting the development and commercialization of disruptive new clean energy technologies. Ensuring that this technology won’t be corrupted by corporate monopolies or political agendas, Mpowa’s energy-generation devices connect to a decentralized autonomous platform, with its own currency. 	Mpowa is creating a platform for the world to combat energy scarcity and where every individual has the opportunity to choose energy sources that have no hidden side effects, in full respect of Health and Environment. By reducing or eliminating economic disparities caused by the lack of access to affordable clean energy, paired with decentralized technology to ensure social and environmental resilience. Mpowa is creating the foundation for an honest and equitable society.	`The main objective of the pilot-project is to provide safe and sustainably available clean water, at locations where water-born diseases are a root cause for infant-mortality, e.g. rural areas of Africa.	The goal is to also directly tackle fundamental socio-economic problems of energy scarcity, environmental destruction, financial exclusion, and help to mitigate/displace current CO2 intensive energy production technologies like coal and other fossil fuels. 
Besides tackling problems through solutions and partnerships presented by the Mpowa platform, it’s the companies’ mission to spark global creativity and submit/suggest new projects for a better future on earth, through rewarding community engagement.  



## Values

Mpowa aims to create genuine relationships with its customers by giving them the opportunity to really change human-lives for the better.
The Mpowa Team, being at its core humanitarian libertarians, fundamentally believes in the principles espoused in the US Declaration of Independence 
– that all humanity should have the right to Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness. For far too long these inherent rights are abridged, 
curtailed and threatened by the state and out of control economic and political actors. To supplement these fundamental rights, 
FDR famously spoke of the 4 freedoms: Freedom of association, Freedom of conscience, Freedom from fear and, last but not least, Freedom from want.
It is in the last of these - in the field of energy systems - that we aim to make a fundamental shift in world socio-economic affairs from the present
 system of manufactured for-profit scarcity for the advantage of corporations to a system of autonomous energy abundance for the liberation of humanity.
In doing so, we aim to tackle fundamental socio-economic problems of energy scarcity, environmental destruction, and help to mitigate/displace 
current CO2 intensive energy production technologies like coal power.

### Sovereignty 

The idea of sovereignty is closely related to the idea of freedom. 
The sovereign is the only one who is free. He may be a king or queen, but he is also the only one who can make decisions without consulting anyone else.
 The idea of sovereignty is one that has been debated for centuries. It is a complicated concept, and many people have different views on 
what it means to be sovereign. The meaning of sovereignty changes depending on the context in which it is used. Sovereignty can be used as a 
synonym for independence or autonomy, but it can also refer to the legal right of a state to govern itself without outside interference.
	For this purpose, sovereignty is defined as the ability to choose.



### Equality

The world is changing and as such, we need to change the way we think about equality. We should not be focused on equality for the sake of equality,
 but instead focus on abundance and respect. Leaders cannot keep asking for more and more without giving anything in return. 
Mpowa is here to create a balance between what we give and what we get.



### Abundance

Fullness manifests itself in many other ways, and not only as an abundance of money and an abundance of goods. 
Those with an abundance mindset believe that there is an abundance of everything in the world, from resources, love, 
relationships, wealth, and opportunity. Those with an abundance mindset are often visionaries and see limitless possibilities in the world.   
	Those with an abundance mindset are known for thinking big, it's part of their DNA. 
Because of the positive attitude of people with rich mindsets, they take an active approach to life. 
A person with an abundance mindset understands that change is an integral part of life, accepts and accepts change.   
	As in science, progress in life is much easier when you are willing to let go of past beliefs and embrace change. 
Thinking broadly also requires us to let go of past beliefs and assumptions and be open to new facts and ideas. 
Enriched thinking is based on the desire to change our thinking patterns and make room for new ones.    
	If you want to make significant changes in your life, you need to be honest about your way of thinking. 
Think about how the practice affects your future life and dreams.  
It is also contagious and generative, creating a thriving environment and community around us. Abundance manifests itself as many trees, plants, 
animals and various life forms, as well as an infinite number of stars and universes. It is the innate tendency of nature and life to manifest, 
grow and become larger.  
	Abundance is the tendency of life force to produce more and create more out of everything. 
Abundance is a clear concoction that can help you attract wealth and health into your life. 
Abundance nourishes our self-esteem and self-confidence, and helps us remain resilient in times of trouble.
	It is associated with positive thinking and generosity, with a core belief that there is enough for everyone. 
There is abundance in the Universe, and everyone is a part of it, wherever they live, and regardless of his position and circumstances. 
The world will soon have the opportunity to meet and exceed the basic needs of every man, woman and child on the planet. 


### Progress
  
Whether progress is seen in terms of big or small improvements, it matters a lot. However, while we continue to move towards the final goal, 
much remains to be done. For example: to make the internet accessible to everyone, many more systemic changes are needed, but progress is being made. 
	Progress is movement towards a purified, improved, or otherwise desired state. Recently, the concept of progress has been generalized to 
psychology, since it is associated with the concept of a goal, that is, progress is understood as “what is considered a means of moving towards 
the final result of a given specific goal.” Some 20th-century authors refer to The Myth of Progress, referring to the idea that 
human conditions will inevitably improve.	
In the 20th century, romantic critics charged that progress did not automatically improve people's conditions and might somehow make them worse. 
Rogers was one of several reformers in the late 19th century who saw that America's ability to make progress could be greatly improved. 
He envisioned progress as the process of human development through the search for philosophical truths and the introduction of an era 
of material prosperity through technological progress. Marxists are vehemently opposed to capitalism, liberals are staunchly supporters of it, 
but the only concept they can agree on is progress, which asserts that people have the ability to create, improve, and change their societies 
through knowledge, science, technology, and practical experimentation.	By "progress" we mean the combination of economic, technological, 
scientific, cultural and organizational progress that has changed our lives and raised our standard of living over the past two centuries. 
The process of progress and how things move in a positive direction of improvement is called progress. 
In particular, advancement to a higher or more developed state; development, growth. From Middle English progressie, 
from Old French progres ("to go forward"), from Latin progressus (“to move forward"), from the root participle progress 
("to go forward, to advance, to develop"), from pro- (``forward, before' ‘) + degrees (``go, go'') root participle progredi 
(``go ahead, advance, develop''), from pro- (``forward, before di'') + degrees ("walk, go" ).


### Opportunity

Referring back to abundance, opportunity is created by making clear calculations of available resources and making the most of it.	
Families in rural areas of Africa will hopefully remark that it's a great job and an opportunity to work alongside some people in the country who are 
‘’better off’’. Mpowa strongly believes in strengthening equality of opportunity all around the world, and thus being a catalyst for major development.
	Focusing on what matters most can really make a difference in what kids learn. Accounting for the cost of opportunity costs can help individuals and organizations make better decisions.	The purpose of calculating economic profit (and therefore opportunity cost) is to help improve business decision making by including opportunity cost, to get a clear vision of what the future may bring. To further improve business decision making, several measures of economic profit performance have been derived, such as risk-adjusted return on capital (RAROC) and economic value added (EVA), which directly include the quantification of opportunity costs to help companies manage risk and allocate resources. Accounting profits are the real costs (in real monetary terms) of businesses that are included in their balance sheets, financial statements, and income statements, and should be included as implicit costs accounted for by opportunity costs.	When making major decisions, such as buying a home or starting a business, you are likely to carefully consider the pros and cons of your financial decision, but most day-to-day decisions are not made with a full understanding of the potential cost of the opportunity. After Coleman's 1966 Equality of Educational Opportunity report, another debate arose about whether money affects educational outcomes. The common notion of educational inequality, that it is mainly for students who come to school with insufficient skills to benefit from what the school has to offer, is still widely held because the degree of inequality in learning opportunities largely unknown. This makes it even more important that everyone around the world has internet access - to learn everything you want at your own pace.


### Collaboration

Platform = Collaboration Hub. 

Research shows that collaboration can improve results and productivity. 
In short, collaboration makes things easier, which helps us get more done in less time. At the end of the day, 
collaboration is a skill that helps people work together, come up with new ideas, listen to each other, and learn from each other.	
Collaboration skills enable you to successfully work with others to achieve common goals. Most work environments require collaboration, 
so collaboration skills are critical. There are various collaboration skills and communication strategies that, if developed, 
can help improve the overall effectiveness of a team. The United Nations has developed a refined framework for everyone globally to collectively 
contribute and collaborate towards reaching massive goals. Mpowa brings people together to collect ideas, funding and other resources in order to 
increase impact at a faster pace. 	Collaboration with this UN-created community is about learning from each other and sharing knowledge amongst 
teams, not about completing tasks or reaching goals with one group. Effective collaboration is essentially. the exchange of ideas, tasks, 
or skills for the purpose of developing processes, brainstorming, or completing projects. Nature
Understanding how the natural world is presented, valued, and planned as a boon to human well-being is a disturbing challenge to my research. 
Nature-Based Solutions (NbS) involves working with nature to solve social problems, benefiting both human well-being and biodiversity.	
Researchers are increasingly focusing on what they see as weaknesses in traditional reasoning about naturalness. In a recent study by Kevin, a lot of attention was paid to the benefits that people receive from nature, including those related to their health and well-being. A new report examines the impact of climate change on people and nature, and our ability to adapt to it. Environmental sociologist interested in the social and cultural aspects of natural resource management have been particularly involved in the development of an ecosystem approach to natural resource management, which seek to influence and shape from the social sciences and a key starting point.	The British Ecological Society launched the People and Nature Project in recognition of the rapid growth of interdisciplinary and trans-disciplinary research on the relationship between man and nature, and that many of them touch on vital issues.	People and Nature is a large-scale quarterly open access journal publication that explores the relationship between people and nature across all fields of research.	Reported as part of the IPCC's Sixth Climate Science Assessment, humanity can adapt to a warming climate more easily than the natural world. The Persian Gulf will be the first to warm, but "it will become a problem in many parts of the world, including the United States," says Michael Oppenheimer.	Regardless of the scenario, 1 billion people will be exposed to chronic flooding due to rising sea levels. Food insecurity will worsen as malnutrition rises in the global south. For example, ONeill notes, the number of people pushed into poverty in 15 years due to climate change could range from 10 million to 100 million, depending on their vulnerability and the vulnerability of their land.


### Authenticity

The word "authenticity" means the state in which something is authentic, legal, and true. Simply put, authenticity means being true to your personality, your values, and your spirit, no matter how much you are forced to act differently. Today, when people use the term "authenticity" they usually mean that they are honest and open. Their starting point is their perception that the term "authenticity" refers to what is the real, genuine or true term "authenticity".	First, they argue that in order to understand the meaning of authenticity it is necessary to know who or what is the reference point for assessing authenticity, which can be either inside (i.e. the entity itself) or outside the entity (i.e. social category). judge.	In the descriptive use of authenticity, inauthenticity is simply the standard state of everyday life in which our personal relationships are mediated by others. Intellectual descriptions of abstract concepts that constitute authenticity often indicate descriptive limitations of language; in order to describe the negative space surrounding unreal states, unreal life examples illustrate states of real personality. When used in the latter sense, authenticity describes a person acting in accordance with desires, motives, ideals, or beliefs that not only belong to him (and not to others), but also expresses who he really is.	Authenticity is more than making someone believe what they say or act in a way that is consistent with their beliefs. However, authenticity is likely to always mean different things to different people. True authenticity doesn't require you to share your values with anyone because everyone can see your values in the way you live. When you live with sincerity, you don’t have to worry about what you said (or didn't say), how you acted, or whether you did the right thing. 
“Be authentic with Mpowa.”






### Privacy

If you would like to learn more about how Mpowa users use services like Mpowa to process your personal data in payment transactions, 
please contact Mpowa users directly or review the Mpowa User Privacy Policy. Mpowa is responsible for respecting its users’ privacy rights, 
including appropriate disclosures regarding the collection and use of data related to Mpowa user services. Mpowa is not responsible for the 
processing of data by other controllers, including our customers, and you should contact them directly to inquire about how they handle your 
personal information and exercise your privacy rights in relation to such processing, if you suspect them to do so. 	
Through the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and other applicable laws and regulations, individuals may have data subject rights 
that allow them to request access, delete, correct, remove or restrict use, or obtain copies its personal information held by Mpowa or for which 
Mpowa is otherwise responsible. The Privacy Policy informs customers about the collection, use, and sharing of personal information in connection 
with Mpowa provision of the Policy tools.	Other controllers have the duties of other controllers in accordance with applicable privacy laws. 
Confidentiality depends on the rules for disseminating information and whether it is appropriate. Privacy uses the theory of natural 
rights and usually responds to new information and communication technologies. Invasion of privacy, a subset of the expectation of privacy, 
is a concept distinct from the collection, aggregation, and dissemination of information, in that collection is the misuse of existing data, 
while intrusion is an infringement on people's right to keep personal secrets.	To help protect the privacy and security of your information, 
you may be asked to provide additional information to verify your identity and/or ownership before Mpowa exercises your data rights. 
This is information that you provide to Mpowa that identifies you personally, such as your name, email address, or billing information,

This account information is used to authenticate you when you sign in to Mpowa services and to protect your account from unauthorized access by others.
Because circumstances may vary depending on the context and services, the information provided in the Privacy Policy or provided in a 
specific disclosure may contain more detailed information about the applicable storage conditions.











## Problems and solutions

Vulnerable communities in developing nations have limited to no incentive to maintain their local ecosystem and preserve the natural environment. 
Due to extreme poverty and exclusion, pollution, environmental degradation and carbon intensive activities (wood, charcoal, kerosene burning), 
these communities are unhealthy and dangerous places for children to grow up, with high infant mortality rates and incidence of preventable disease.
	GHG emissions contribute to the overall carbon intensity of the South African economy, being 9th in the world overall and highest within 
the G20 group of nations in segment “Destruction of the local ecosystem” which leads to a negative spiral of neglect and despondency, 
species/wildlife depletion and unsanitary living conditions.	Another example, when inspecting research data, is that only 7% of the population
 in Uganda has a had a sustainable form of clean water available for them. There’s a significant need for support in several African countries, 
hence our pilot projects will likely take place that region of the world. 
	Mpowa recognizes that poverty eradication, changing unsustainable and promoting sustainable patterns of consumption and production 
and protecting and managing the natural resource base of economic and social development are the overarching objectives of and essential 
requirements for sustainable development. We also reaffirm the need to achieve sustainable development by promoting sustained, 
inclusive and equitable economic growth, creating greater opportunities for all, reducing inequalities, raising basic standards of living, 
fostering equitable social development and inclusion, and promoting the integrated and sustainable management of natural resources and ecosystems 
that supports, inter alia, economic, social and human development while facilitating ecosystem conservation, regeneration and restoration 
and resilience in the face of new and emerging challenges.	Mpowa reaffirms the importance of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,
1 as well as other international instruments relating to human rights and international law. Mpowa emphasizes the responsibilities to respect, 
protect and promote human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, without distinction of any kind as to race, color, sex, language, religion, 
political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth, disability or other status.	
Through working together with local “Heroes” and NGO’s, Mpowa has the capacity to scale its area of contribution to a large extend. 
It is prospected that several rural areas in Africa, in different countries, will start to receive support from Q3 2022 onwards. 	
By keeping the data and measurements conform to the Data Structure Definition (as defined by the UN), 
Mpowa allows its projects to be officially regarded as legitimate and impactful, to ensure contributors that their contribution will result i
nto legally verifiable impact. Mpowa’s approach of reporting and will be acquired once the technology has been funded for deployment, 
to enable Mpowa to credibly present themselves to these organizations. A specific set of SDG indicators is selected by Mpowa, 
in terms of relevancy based on impact from projects that are currently on its agenda. Indicators are selected by applicability on and for 
the projects that are currently managed by the platform and for prioritized future projects. Project impact is driven to certain indicators and 
impact is noted and confirmed by official mathematical models. Listed below are 17 problems, derived from statistical observations, 
by studying the United Nations Sustainability Development Goals and the issues that are addressed in the 2030 Agenda. 
NFT’s will contain the necessary metadata according to the UN DSD’s for the impact to be processed and included into reports. 





### Problem 1: 

Poverty in all its forms. The international poverty line is a threshold used to measure extreme poverty based on consumption or income levels. 
A person is considered extremely poor if his or her consumption or income level falls below the minimum level necessary to meet basic needs. 
International poverty line is the absolute global minimum is per 2022 $3,20 (in PPP). The indicator is produced globally using micro-level data 
on household income or consumption expenditures from nationally representative household surveys, which is reported to the World Bank’s development 
research group and/or the ILO (for working poverty). Only nationally representative surveys that contain sufficient information to produce a 
comprehensive consumption or income aggregate (including consumption or income from own production) and allow for the construction of a correctly 
weighted distribution of per capita consumption or income are used. 	
Examples of surveys include household income and expenditure surveys (HIES), living standards measurement surveys (LSMS) with employment modules, 
or labour force surveys (LFS) that collect information on household income. Such surveys also offer the benefit of allowing the employment status 
and income (or consumption expenditure) variables to be derived from the same sampled households ideally for the same long observation period. 
Poverty is basically result of resource scarcity. National definitions of poverty vary amongst the globe.


##### Solution: Social protection systems, appropriately nationally implemented for all. 
Equal rights to economic resources and access to basic services, ownership and control over land and other forms 


##### Relevant indicators for Mpowa:

Indicator 1.1.1: Proportion of the population living below the international poverty line by sex, age, employment status and geographic location (urban/rural).

Indicator 1.2.1: Proportion of population living below the national poverty line, by sex and age.

Indicator 1.2.2: Proportion of men, women and children of all ages living in poverty in all its dimensions according to national definitions.

Indicator 1.4.1: Proportion of population living in households with access to basic services.

Indicator 1.4.2: Proportion of total adult population with secure tenure rights to land, (a) with legally recognized documentation, and (b) who perceive their rights to land as secure, by sex and type of tenure.








#### Mpowa’s Contribution: 

Local heroes can apply and submit to new projects in the area of their preference and get rewarded once a completed task has been verified by the DAO, funding can be raised prior to completion in order to create a strong incentive for the heroes to finalize the project and find additional people in the area to apply for the job that he/she has created. 
In the chapter “The Technology” you will read about the implementation of goal indicators into smart-contracts for blockchain verification. 





### Problem 2: Hunger, food insecurity. Undernourishment.
The prevalence of undernourishment (PoU) is the proportion of the population whose habitual food consumption is insufficient to provide the 
dietary energy levels that are required to maintain a normal active and healthy life. It is expressed as a percentage. 
Undernourishment is defined as chronic hunger, a condition where a person has inadequate access to food amounts necessary to provide the 
energy required for conducting a normal, health and active life, given their individual dietary energy requirements over a period of at least one year. 
The concept encompasses three aspects: availability of food, inequality in access to that food, and minimum dietary energy requirements 
compatible with long term good health. Undernourishment is prevalent globally, hence the pressing need for water/energy/agriculture solutions to be 
deployed within a short time frame in order to combat malnutrition and the health/learning problems that arise from the issue. 

#### Solution: 

End hunger and ensure access by all people to safe, nutritious and sufficient food all year round. 
By 2030, end hunger and ensure access by all people, in particular the poor and people in vulnerable situations, 
including infants, to safe, nutritious and sufficient food all year round

#### Relevant indicators for Mpowa:

Indicator 2.1.1: Prevalence of undernourishment.

Indicator 2.3.2: Average income of small-scale food producers, by sex and indigenous status.

### Problem 3: Preventable death and illness.

This indicator monitors deaths related to pregnancy and childbirth. It reflects the capacity of health systems to provide effective health care in preventing and addressing the complications occurring during pregnancy and childbirth.	Indicator values range from less than 10 in most developed countries, with an average of around 169 per 100,000 live births in the developing regions. 	Primarily due to lack of clean water and sanitation. The under-five mortality rate (U5MR) is the probability (expressed as a rate per 1,000 live births) of a child born in a specified year or period dying before reaching the age of five if subject to current age-specific mortality rates. 	Mortality rates among young children are a key output indicator for child health and well-being, and, more broadly, for social and economic development. It is a closely watched public health indicator because it reflects the access of children and communities to basic health interventions such as sanitation, education, medical treatment of infectious diseases and adequate nutrition, natural supplementation and emergency-care (hospitals). 

By 2030, all countries are expected to reduce under-5 mortality to at least as low as 25 per 1,000 live births. 	The neonatal mortality rate (NMR) is the probability that a child born in a specific year or period will die during the first 28 completed days of life if subject to current age-specific mortality rates, expressed per 1000 live births. 	Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is a virus that weakens the immune system, ultimately leading to Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS). HIV destroys the body’s ability to fight off infection and disease, which can ultimately lead to death. Without treatment, median survival from the time of infection is about 10.5 years for males and 11.5 years for females. Access to treatment improves the health of the individual, increases survival to near normal life expectancies, and greatly reduces the chance of onward transmission. Treatment coverage has increased rapidly since the early 2000s but still varies by region. No vaccine is currently available. 	By 2030, end the epidemics of AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and neglected tropical diseases and combat hepatitis, water-borne diseases and other communicable diseases. 

Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are a diverse group of communicable diseases that prevail in tropical and subtropical conditions in more than 100 countries. They include the following diseases: Buruli ulcer, Chagas disease, dengue, dracunculiasis (guinea-worm disease), echinococcosis, foodborne trematodiases, human African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness), leishmaniases, leprosy, lymphatic filariasis, mycetoma, onchocerciasis (river blindness), rabies, schistosomiasis, soil-transmitted helminthiases, taeniasis and neurocysticercosis, trachoma, and yaws. An up-to-date list is available at http://www.who.int/neglected_diseases/diseases/en/. 
 Other key interventions against NTDs (e.g. vector management, veterinary public health, water, sanitation and hygiene) are to be addressed in the context of other targets and indicators, namely Universal Health Coverage (UHC) and universal access to water and sanitation. 	There are many more diseases that occur on this planet and negatively affect human beings, that find ground in bodies when the immune system of the person is compromised. 
 
 Besides that, there are still people who lose their lives by committing suicide, because of severely low levels of well being and lack of psychological guidance. This has to be countered and is a main mission of the Heroes Academy. 
Ambient air pollution refers to outdoor pollution resulting from emissions from industrial activity, households, cars and trucks, etc. Household air pollution refers to indoor pollution resulting from the use of polluting cooking fuels such as kerosene, wood, coal animal dung, charcoal and crop wastes. Ambient and household are often treated separately, although they are strongly interlinked since household air pollution is a large –often underestimated – source of ambient air pollution. They have been dealt with separately by both scientist and policy makers for historical and practical reasons. Household air pollution also include the use of polluting fuels for lighting and heating purposes. 


Rationale and Interpretation: 

The target aims to reduce the number of deaths from hazardous air pollution. This indicator tracks mortality rates attributed to ambient and household air pollution, as air pollution is the biggest environmental risk to health. 
Vital registration systems are the preferred source of data on under-five mortality because they collect information prospectively and cover the entire population. However, many low and lower middle income countries lack fully functioning vital registration systems that accurately record all births and deaths. Thus, household surveys, such as Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), and periodic population censuses have become the primary source of data on child mortality in low and lower middle income countries. 
National Statistical Office or the Ministry of Health are mostly involved in generating under-five mortality data at the national level. 
Deaths attributable to unsafe water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) are counted using the WASH attributable fractions of diarrhea (ICD-10 code A00, A01, A03, A04, A06-A09), intestinal nematode infections (ICD-10 code B76- B77, B79) and protein-energy malnutrition (ICD-10 code E40-E46). 
The number of deaths from unsafe water, sanitation and hygiene can be prevented by improving those services and practices. Therefore, measuring the number of deaths that can be attributed to unsafe WASH supports progress towards such prevention. 
Most recent disease-specific national mortality figures can be downloaded from the website of the WHO Global Health Observatory’s (GHO) website: http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/estimates/en/ 
There’s a significant percentage of people dying from unintentional poisoning, hence the need for more environmental measurements that are all logged on the blockchain, in order to avoid further casualties in this area.

#### Solution
Clean water, sanitation supplies, supplies for allowing safe child birth, increasing access to quality nutrition for all human beings.

### Problem 4: Educational deficits 

Minimum proficiency level corresponds to the minimum set of skills or knowledge required for a given subject such as reading or mathematics. Learning assessments are designed to measure a range of skill levels which are defined during the design of the assessment. As the assessment design can vary between national assessments and across international assessments ideally these benchmarks should to be aligned. Minimum proficiency levels for existing cross-national learning assessments have been provisionally adopted by the international community for interim reporting but in order to increase country coverage there is a need to achieve comparability across national and international assessments. 

#### Solution: Goal 4. Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all

#### Relevant indicators for Mpowa: 

Indicator 4.1.1: Proportion of children and young people (a) in Grades 2 /3; (b) at the end of primary; and (c) at the end of lower secondary achieving at least a minimum proficiency level in (i) reading and (ii) mathematics, by sex.

Indicator 4.3.1: Participation rate of youth and adults in formal and non-formal education and training in the previous 12 months, by sex.

Indicator 4.4.1: Proportion of youth and adults with information and communications technology (ICT) skills, by type of skill.

Indicator 4.5.1: Parity indices (female/male, rural/urban, bottom/top wealth quintile and others such as disability status, indigenous peoples and conflict-affected, as data become available) for all education indicators on this list that can be disaggregated. 

Indicator 4.6.1: Proportion of population in a given age group achieving at least a fixed level of proficiency in functional (a) literacy and (b) numeracy skills, by sex.

### Problem 5: Inequality 

Equality and non-discrimination on the basis of sex are core principles under the international legal and policy framework, including the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), which has 189 States parties, and the Beijing Platform for Action. This framework sets out the commitments of States to eliminate discrimination against women and promote gender equality, including in the area of legal frameworks. 

Solution: Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls

#### Relevant indicators for Mpowa:

Indicator 5.1.1: Whether or not legal frameworks are in place to promote, enforce and monitor equality and non-discrimination on the basis of sex.


#### Mpowa’s Contribution:
End all forms of discrimination against all women and girls everywhere, through AI and CCTV collaboration.


### Problem 6: Water pollution and scarcity.

This indicator is defined as the proportion of population using an improved drinking water source which is accessible on premises, available when needed and free from fecal and priority chemical contamination. 	Improved drinking water sources include piped water into dwelling, yard or plot (on premises); public taps or standpipes; boreholes or tube-wells; protected dug wells; protected springs; packaged water; delivered water and rainwater. 	A water source is considered to be accessible on premises if the point of collection is within the dwelling, yard, or plot. Available when needed implies that households are able to access sufficient quantities of water when needed.	Free from fecal or chemical contamination refers to the compliance to relevant national and local standards. In cases where such standards do not exist, reference is made to the WHO Guidelines for Drinking Water Quality. 	This indicator adds additional normative dimensions of accessibility, availability and quality, interpreted as safely managed drinking water services, to the existing MDG metric that tracked use of ‘improved drinking water sources’. It is a proxy for measuring equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water. Improved drinking water sources are not necessarily safe, but are more likely to be protected from external contaminants than unimproved sources either by intervention or through their design and construction. Greater access to safely managed drinking water services is important as it contributes to lowering the incidence of many diseases throughout the world. 	Total freshwater withdrawal (TFWW) is the volume of freshwater extracted from its source (rivers, lakes, aquifers) for the following three main sectors: agriculture, industries and services (including municipalities and domestic water withdrawal). It is estimated at the country level and on an annual basis. The category of freshwater withdrawal includes withdrawals from surface freshwater, groundwater and fossil groundwater. It does not include direct use of non-conventional water, i.e. treated wastewater, agricultural drainage water and desalinated water. 





#### Solution: 

Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all.
In addition, line ministries and water utility companies usually keep records based on the number and type of water supplies constructed or the number of piped household connections maintained. Provider-based data do not include what facilities are actually used, thus, they are only used for countries that have no survey or census data on access to or use of drinking water sources. However, such administrative sources may have much more data on water quality, especially for piped water supplies, which can be gained through household surveys. 
The WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene (JMP) estimates use of improved drinking water sources, as well as the extent to which such sources are located on premises, available when needed, and free from microbiological and chemical contamination, for each country. 


#### *Relevant indicators for Mpowa:*

Indicator 6.1.1: Proportion of population using safely managed drinking water services

Indicator 6.4.2: Level of water stress: freshwater withdrawal as a proportion of available freshwater resources


#### Mpowa’s Contribution:

### Problem 7: Energy deficits, high prices and from unsustainable sources

This indicator is defined as the number of people using clean fuels and technologies for domestic cooking, heating and lighting divided by total population reporting any cooking, heating or lighting. It is expressed as a percentage. 

The renewable energy share in total final consumption is the percentage of final consumption of energy that is derived from renewable resources. 
Concepts: 
Renewable energy consumption includes consumption of energy derived from: hydro, solid biofuels, wind, solar, liquid biofuels, biogas, geothermal, marine and waste. Total final energy consumption is calculated from national balances and statistics as total final consumption minus non-energy use. 
Comments with regard to specific renewable energy resources: 
Solar energy consumption includes solar PV and solar thermal Liquid biofuel energy consumption includes biogasoline, biodiesels and other liquid biofuels Solid biofuel consumption includes fuelwood, animal waste, vegetable waste, black liquor, bagasse and charcoal Waste energy covers energy from renewable municipal waste

Indicator 7.2.1: Renewable energy share in the total final energy consumption


#### Mpowa’s Contribution: 

Long term vision. 



### Problem 8: Economic collapse / stagnation

This indicator is defined as the percentage change in the real GDP per capita between two consecutive years. 
Concepts: 
GDP is the measure of the monetary value of final goods and services which are produced in an economic territory/country in a given time period. It is calculated without making deductions for depreciation of produced assets or for depletion and degradation of natural resources. It can be measured either by: 
(1)  The expenditure method – the sum of expenditures on final consumption, gross capital formation and net exports; or 
(2)  The production method – the value of final outputs minus any intermediate consumption, plus the net taxes (taxes minus subsidies); or 
(3)  The income approach – the sum of compensation of employees, gross operating surplus, gross mixed incomes and the net taxes on both 
production and imports. 
Real GDP is GDP adjusted for price changes using the ratio of prices in the current year to the prices in a given base year. Real GDP per capita is real GDP dividing by the population of a country. 
The population of a country may comprise either all usual residents of the country or all persons present in the country at the time of a population census. 





#### Solution: 

Target 8.1: Sustain per capita economic growth in accordance with national circumstances and, in particular, at least 7 per cent gross domestic product growth per annum in the least developed countries

Goal 8: Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all 

Target 8.3: Promote development-oriented policies that support productive activities, decent job creation, entrepreneurship, creativity and innovation, and encourage the formalization and growth of micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises, including through access to financial services

However, labour input more widely refers to all persons who contribute to the production of goods and services within the SNA production boundary, not only the employed. In fact, according to the new standards laid out in the 2013 Resolution concerning statistics of work, employment and labour underutilization, the labour input contributing to the GDP comprises not only employment (work done for use by others for pay or profit) but also own-use production of goods, unpaid trainee work and some forms of volunteer work as well. 

Target 8.5: By 2030, achieve full and productive employment and decent work for all women and men, including for young people and persons with disabilities, and equal pay for work of equal value

Target 8.8: Protect labour rights and promote safe and secure working environments for all workers, including migrant workers, in particular women migrants, and those in precarious employment.

### Problem 13: Climate change

This indicator measures the number of countries that adopt and implement national disaster risk reduction (DRR) strategies in line with the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030, with multiple dimensions of the level of implementation. 
Disaster risk reduction strategies: define goals and objectives across different timescales and with concrete targets, indicators and time frames. In line with the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030, these should be aimed at preventing the creation of disaster risk, the reduction of existing risk and the strengthening of economic, social, health and environmental resilience. 

#### Solution:

The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 was adopted by UN Member States in March 2015 as a global policy of disaster risk reduction. Among the global targets, “Target A: Substantially reduce global disaster mortality by 2030, aiming to lower average per 100,000 global mortality between 2020-2030 compared with 2005-2015” and “Target B: Substantially reduce the number of affected people globally by 2030, aiming to lower the average global figure per 100,000 between 2020-2030 compared with 2005-2015” will contribute to sustainable development and strengthen economic, social, health and environmental resilience. The economic, environmental and social perspectives would include poverty eradication, urban resilience, and climate change adaptation. 

Goal 13: Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impact



#### Relevant indicators for Mpowa:

#### Mpowa’s Contribution:

All projects, basically. Strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related hazards and natural disasters in all countries

























### Problem 14: Marine pollution
“Marine pollution occurs when substances used or spread by humans, such as industrial, agricultural and residential waste, particles, noise, excess carbon dioxide or invasive organisms enter the ocean and cause harmful effects there. The majority of this waste (80%) comes from land-based activity, although marine transportation significantly contributes as well. Since most inputs come from land, either via the rivers, sewage or the atmosphere, it means that continental shelves are more vulnerable to pollution. Air pollution is also a contributing factor by carrying off iron, carbonic acid, nitrogen, silicon, sulfur, pesticides or dust particles into the ocean. The pollution often comes from nonpoint sources such as agricultural runoff, wind-blown debris, and dust. These non-point sources are largely due to runoff that enters the ocean through rivers, but wind-blown debris and dust can also play a role, as these pollutants can settle into waterways and oceans. Pathways of pollution include direct discharge, land runoff, ship pollution, atmospheric pollution and, potentially, deep sea mining."


#### Solution:

Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development.



#### Relevant indicators for Mpowa:

Indicator 14.4.1: Proportion of fish stocks within biologically sustainable levels

Indicator 14.5.1: Coverage of protected areas in relation to marine areas

Conserve coastal and marine areas, consistent with national and international law and based on the best available scientific information.















### Problem 15: Deforestation

The proportion of forest area of the total land area of many countries is decreasing. UN Statistics can be found online and are represented as a percentage of land-mass covered by trees. 
Concepts: 
Forest is defined as land spanning more than 0.5 hectares with trees higher than 5 meters and a canopy cover of more than 10 percent, or trees able to reach these thresholds in situ. It does not include land that is predominantly under agricultural or urban land use. Additional detailed criteria are listed in FAO’s Forest Resource Assessment (FRA) 2020 Terms and Definitions Document available at: http://www.fao.org/3/I8661EN /i8661en.pdf. 
Total land area refers to the total surface area of a country excluding the area covered by inland waters, such as major rivers and lakes. Total land area of the reference year 2015 is used. 
Rationale and Interpretation: 
The availability of accurate data on a country's forest area is a key element for forest policy and planning within the context of sustainable development. Forest area as a proportion of total land area can provide a rough proxy for the extent to which the forests in a country are being conserved or restored. 

Forest area data are typically collected through field inventories and/or remote sensing. Field inventories are based on statistical sampling or aggregation of data collected for management inventories. Remote sensing has often an important role in these efforts either as an auxiliary data source which can be used to improve the efficiency of the field inventories, or as an input allowing direct assessment of land cover and its changes. Comprehensive guidance on how to establish a national forest monitoring system can be found in http://www.fao.org/3/a-I6767e.pdf 
Forest resources assessments are typically carried out by national forest authorities as part of statistical data collection activities of Ministry of Forestry, Agriculture or Environment or their combination. 


The Red List Index is an index that measures changes in aggregate extinction risk across groups of species. It is based on the number of species in each category of extinction risk on The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species (IUCN 2015) is expressed as changes in an index ranging from 0 to 1. 
This is an indicator that is monitored at the global level. 
Concepts: 
Threatened species are those listed on The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species in the categories Vulnerable, Endangered, or Critically Endangered (i.e., species that are facing a high, very high, or extremely high risk of extinction in the wild in the medium-term future). 
Rationale and Interpretation: 
The world’s species are impacted by a number of threatening processes, including habitat destruction and degradation, overexploitation, invasive alien species, human disturbance, pollution and climate change. This indicator can be used to assess overall changes in the extinction risk of groups of species as a result of these threats and the extent to which threats are being mitigated.

This indicator is defined as the number of countries that have adopted legislative, administrative and policy frameworks for the implementation of the Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilization to the Convention on Biological Diversity (2010). 
This indicator is an international indicator and not monitored at the national level. 
Concepts: 
The Nagoya Protocol, also referred to the Nagoya Protocol on Access and Benefit Sharing (ABS) is a 2010 supplementary agreement to the 1992 Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) that aims to implement the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources, thereby contributing to the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity. 

The data for this indicator comes from the ABS Clearing-House, which is maintained by the CBD secretariat. Countries provide the information on ABS legislative, administrative and policy frameworks to the ABS Clearing-House directly by filling a form containing information and details about their frameworks. 
In order to ensure the accuracy of the information published in the ABS Clearing-House, all ABS frameworks are submitted to the clearing house by designated publishing authorities (a single authority for each country)

### Problem 16: Violence, abuse, exploitation. 

The use of violent (physical or verbal) disciplining techniques are a violation of children’s rights, and can result in immediate effects and long-term consequences that children carry well into adulthood. It is the most widespread and socially accepted type of violence against children. Data is collected through nationally representative household surveys that include a module on violence against children which are conducted by national statistical offices. Internationally coordinated household surveys such as the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) and the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) also collect this data in low and middle-income countries. 

According to General Comment no. 13 on the Convention of the Rights of the Child (CRC), sexual violence against children comprises any sexual activities imposed by an adult on a child against which the child is entitled to protection by criminal law. This includes: 
(1) The inducement or coercion of a child to engage in any unlawful or psychologically harmful sexual activity; 
(2) The use of children in commercial sexual exploitation; 
(3) The use of children in audio or visual images of child sexual abuse; and 
(4) Child prostitution, sexual slavery, sexual exploitation in travel and tourism, trafficking for purposes of sexual exploitation (within and between countries), sale of children for sexual purposes and forced marriage. 
Sexual activities are also considered as abuse when committed against a child by another child if the offender is significantly older than the victim or uses power, threat or other means of pressure. Consensual sexual activities between children are not considered as sexual abuse if the children are older than the age limit defined by the State Party. 
‘Sexual violence’ is operationally defined in the indicator as sexual intercourse or any other sexual acts that were forced, physically or in any other way. 

Experiences of sexual violence in childhood hinder all aspects of development: physical, psychological/emotional and social. Apart from the physical injuries that can result, researchers have consistently found that the sexual abuse of children is associated with a wide array of mental health consequences and adverse behavioral outcomes in adulthood. The issue is universally relevant, and the indicator captures one of the gravest forms of violence against children. The right of children to protection from all forms of violence is outlined in the CRC and its Optional Protocols. 

A National Human Rights Institution (NHRI) is an independent administrative body set up by a country with a constitutional or legislative mandate to promote and protect human rights. They are a part of the national administration but operate independently from the government. The general role of NHRIs is to address discrimination in all its forms, as well as to promote the protection of civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights. Core functions of NHRIs include complaint handling, human rights education and making recommendations on law reform. An independent NHRI has ‘A level’ accreditation to the Paris Principles. 
Paris Principles were adopted by the UN General Assembly in Resolution 48/134 on 20th December 1993, and provide the international standards on the independent functioning of NHRI. These standards serve as the basis on which NHRIs are accredited by the Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI). For more information, see: http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages /StatusOfNationalInstitutions.aspx 
GANHRI is the international association of NHRIs which promotes and strengthens NHRIs to be in accordance with the Paris Principles and provides leadership in the promotion and protection of human rights (ICC Statute, Art. 5). 
Accreditation by GANHRI entails determination whether NHRI are compliant, both in law and in practice, with the Paris principles. The process is conducted by the Sub-Committee on Accreditation (SCA) of the GANHRI. 

Accreditation of NHRIs shows that the government has a strong commitment to realize human rights in the country. Effective NHRIs are an important link between government and civil society. They contribute significantly to bridging the “protection gap” between the human rights of individuals and the State’s obligations under international law. Six models of NHRIs exist across all regions of the world today, namely: human rights commissions, human rights ombudsperson institutions, hybrid institutions, consultative and advisory bodies, institutes and centers and multiple institutions. This indicator expresses whether any of these models exist in a country and is independently functioning to protect and promote human rights, including by preventing and redressing their violations.

#### Solution:
Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels


#### Relevant indicators for Mpowa:

Indicator 16.a.1: Existence of independent national human rights institutions in compliance with the Paris Principles

Indicator 16.2.1: Proportion of children aged 1-17 years who experienced any physical punishment and/or psychological aggression by caregivers in the past month

Indicator 16.2.3: Proportion of young women and men aged 18-29 years who experienced sexual violence by age 18


#### Mpowa’s Contribution:

Strengthen relevant national institutions, including through international cooperation, for building capacity at all levels, in particular in developing countries, to prevent violence and combat terrorism and crime
End abuse, exploitation, trafficking and all forms of violence against and torture of children. 
End abuse, exploitation, trafficking and all forms of violence against and torture of children.







### Problem 17: Absence or shortage of fruitful partnerships in order to reach and succeed the SDGs 

This indicator is defined as the number of fixed internet broadband connections/subscriptions of different speed tiers per 100 inhabitants of a country. The speed tiers considered are advertised downstream speeds of: 
(1)  256 Kilobits per second (Kbps) to 2Megabits per second (Mbps); 
(2)  2Mbps to 10 Mbps; and 
(3)  Greater than 10 Mbps. 

Fixed internet broadband refers to subscriptions to high-speed access to public internet at downstream speeds greater than 256Kbps. It includes cable modem, DSL, fiber-to-the-home, other fixed (wired) broadband, satellite broadband and terrestrial fixed wireless broadband. It does not include internet access through mobile-cellular networks, and includes both residential and organizational subscriptions. 
Advertised downstream speeds refers to the speed advertised by the Internet service providers at which data (including files, web sites, pictures, music, movies, etc) could be delivered to Internet subscribers. The advertised speed can differ from the actual speed of connection that a user may experience at the time of Internet use. 

The internet has become an increasingly important tool to provide access to information that can help foster and enhance regional and international cooperation and access, particularly in the contexts of science, technology, innovations, through knowledge sharing. Limits to broadband connections is a barrier to target 17.6, and therefore, the measurement of the number of broadband connections provides insight into the level of enabling environment for such cooperation. 




#### Solution:
Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development 


#### Relevant indicators for Mpowa:

Indicator 17.2.1: Net official development assistance, total and to least developed countries, as a proportion of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Development Assistance Committee donors' gross national income (GNI) 

Indicator 17.6.1: Fixed internet broadband subscriptions per 100 inhabitants, by speed.

Indicator 17.8.1: Proportion of individuals using the internet.


#### Mpowa’s Contribution:

Enhance international cooperation on and access to science, technology and innovation and enhance knowledge-sharing on mutually agreed terms, including through improved collaboration through technology. 
- Mobilizing additional financial resources for developing countries from multiple sources.






## The necessity for Mpowa’s existence

Due to the global scale of the severe issues that the world is facing today, an all-encompassing platform to enable clean-tech innovation to step in and repair the damage that has been done, is necessary. Social-economic incentives, coordinated by DAO-imposed parameters is likely the most efficient strategy.
It's impossible to provide an exhaustive list of what you can do to protect the environment, but here's Mpowa. The platform makes it relatively simple to reduce your carbon footprint, collectively take ‘’green’’ action, and drive huge change with the click of a few buttons. Additionally, there are many things you can do every day to help reduce your greenhouse gas and carbon footprint, thereby reducing your harmful impact on the environment. While many policies must come from our local, state, federal and global leaders, there is also a lot you can do to make a difference. By working together, citizens, businesses and governments can achieve great things.
	These important climate conversations can happen naturally and randomly in your personal life, eventually triggered by Mpowa. By making a few small changes in your next conversation, mention that you can make a big impact on our planet without completely giving up convenience. 
	With a broader understanding of the (climate/energy/resource) crisis at hand, customers can take conscious and deliberate action to change our culture as a whole, because the earth’s climate depends on it. Mpowa is at core a company founded to support the commercialization of renewable energy technologies, starting with our own proprietary Omni home energy management solution which integrates a number of innovative hardware and software solutions to offer a groundbreaking customer experience. The commercial opportunity arising from this technology alone has unicorn potential.	The fundamental challenge however is, aside from the “it sounds too good to be true because it violates the laws of physics” argument, that such technologies disrupt heavily entrenched ecosystems and industries with significant political-economic clout + control of governments / markets in which we wish to operate. Therefore in order to “shock the market” with a technology this disruptive, we have to think big and be ready to go to market in a way which takes no prisoners as far as the existing market players are concerned. Entering the market with a traditional business model/corporate structure will be rightly perceived as a massive threat and no doubt will trigger various forms of resistance, interference, or outright suppression.



## Unique Selling Point

Not only serving merely as a project enabler on its SaaS platform, Mpowa is actually concerned with the direct manifestation of projects by using a bottom-up approach. A complete range of disciplines and sectors are covered and included in the thought-process when Mpowa starts or receives a new project, in order to present something truly beneficial and feasible towards its investors. 			Mpowa has the infrastructure for collaborators to bring their projects up to a certain standard, to facilitate credible project-scaling. While Mpowa is doing things differently than most of its direct competitors, it is always designed for increased service towards the customer and the planet. Thus, writing about Mpowa’s Unique Selling Point forced the Management Team to think about exactly what value it brings to its customers and why they should start contributing to the platform and its related projects. 	An interesting and fairly unique feature is the implementation of an openly accessible product/service-demand submission form for people in need. Submissions will be verified for authenticity and correctness. If the submission comes from a person/entity in an area where Mpowa doesn’t have any projects planned, it can (depending on the severity of the situation) spark the company to start a project (in the area of the submission) or decide to serve the person individually. By demand and supply, NFT’s will be created and minted to serve the need and also contains a certificate for the purchaser that can be used to claim SDG Impact Tokens, Tokenized Carbon Credits and/or Governance Tokens. 	What really matters for contributors to the platform is that they each have a transparent overview of where they’ve sent their money, how it's being used and which impact their contribution has realized. Mpowa is selling impact, sustainability and health to those who care about planet earth and its inhabitants in an auditable and regulatory compliant way, with implementation of its project impact-data in UN SDG reporting. 










## Scalability

In case there’s an unexpectedly large interest from the audience to contribute towards a certain project, there are solutions to scale the project or at least realize new projects without significant delay, due to partnerships with companies that can provide Mpowa and its beneficiaries with similar technology.  

Scalability and Technology Scalability and technology blend well and are inseparable for an efficient transition during growth. A system may be considered scalable if it can adapt to the changing needs or patterns of its users. It is often a sign of competitiveness because a scalable network or system is ready to handle increased demand, trends, and needs, even with the emergence of new competitors.
Technology eases the process of scaling an entity. For instance, companies based on technology operations, e.g., information technology (IT) firms, find it easy to scale their processes. Since these companies are tech-savvy, they see huge growth opportunities. The main reason for their ease of scaling is the fact that these companies keep little or no inventory, while many of them also utilize the Software as a Service (SaaS) approach to dealing with stock. Other entities can incorporate technology into their operations to ease their work even as they plan to grow.
Technology links businesses directly to clients, especially in the advertising world where the digital platform makes advertisements easy and affordable even for small and medium-sized enterprises. This makes technology a powerful tool that can benefit even those enterprises that are not directly connected to technology.
Therefore, technology becomes a necessity in every business, with many businesses incorporating an IT department into their enterprises. It provides a platform to increase the customer base through online advertisement and signups, with some businesses even opting to go entirely online without any physical stores. The financial sector continues to increase its online presence by investing in online banking where customers can enroll and transact without physically going to the bank.
 


What is a Scalable Business? For a business to be scalable, it must focus on improving the profitability and efficiency of services even when its workload increases. The improvement of profitability and efficiency can only originate from the core of the business’ structure and workflow strategy.

Scalability thus begins with the entity developing a set of leaders who run the operations with the necessary technical know-how. The leaders should understand their duties well and their respective hierarchies. All shareholders, including investors and advisors, should be involved in every part of the way as the strategy and direction of the entity is determined.

The scalability of a business also depends on the effectiveness of communication, whether internally to the workforce or externally to clients and investors. Consistency in brand messaging should persist, as it helps the public understand and become persuaded into liking the product.




## SDG Impact 

Contributing to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals requires parties to follow certain data standards and methods of proceeding and documentation of projects. 
One of which is the Data Standards Definition. The required data will be included in NFT’s that will be linked to products or services that beneficiaries will receive after a project is funded. 
Impact is measured through sticking with guiding principles from the UN SDG Handbook and the indicators which are specifically mentioned and implemented into official reports by statisticians.

The distribution of Mpowa SDG-Impact Tokens is done in a regulated manner where the contribution amount in Mpowa Utility Tokens is equivalent (a 1:1 ratio) to the amount of SDG-Impact Tokens that the contributor will receive. 
Impact analysis is the act of studying the requirements’ data, to understand the pros and cons of any change. As the world keeps evolving, changes are to be expected, even in a well-developed system.	Changes can happen for a variety of reasons: a change in a client’s requirements, adjustments to business needs or new technologies. Since changes can potentially result in a failure, it is prudent to proceed with proper planning when making necessary changes.
This is where “Impact Analysis” comes in.
This is a technique that helps to identify the consequences of any changes being planned in software or a product.

The impact-calculation of projects and products that are offered by Mpowa will be described in the chapter ‘’Methodology”.



Marketing Strategy
Carbon offset SDG nature clean water platform technology opportunity.

Customer profile - The problems we solve for them


	This project has been developed in order to contribute to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and it's doing so by providing clean water through Carbon Offset.

It is the first project that integrates carbon offset, water purification and natural eco-system restoration into a single mechanism for sustainable development.
The SDG Nature Clean Water Platform is a project that aims to provide clean water for the world. The platform is based on a new technology called Carbon Offset, which is an innovative way of solving the water crisis.	A SaaS platform is a software that is designed to be accessed over the internet. It can be accessed by multiple users and has a subscription-based pricing model. The nature of a SaaS platform is that it's accessible from anywhere and it's scalable. This means that the more people who use the software, the more powerful it becomes for everyone who uses it. The USP is the position of your small business as a whole, which can be incorporated into your products, your brand, the experiences you offer, and any other points of contact your customers have with your business. The USP should give you a good idea of who the company's ideal client is. The USP for your business should be backed up by real customer experiences and competitor insights, not just telling the market what the market wants to hear. 



## SDG Partnership registration

One of the requirements to register for Partnership for SDGs with the UN are a clearly defined set of data that is in accordance with the SMART criteria. 

The Partnerships for SDGs online platform is United Nations’ global registry of voluntary commitments and multi-stakeholder partnerships made in support of sustainable development and the 17 Sustainable Development Goals. The Partnerships for SDGs platform also facilitates the sharing knowledge and expertise among multi-stakeholder SDG-related partnerships and voluntary commitments, and for providing periodic updates on their progress.	The Partnership for SDGs platform is open to all stakeholders, including Member States, civil society, local authorities, private sector, scientific and technological community, academia, and others, to register a voluntary commitment or multi-stakeholder partnership which aims to drive the implementation of the 2030 Agenda and the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and to provide periodic updates on progress.



Criteria for Registration
The Partnership for SDGs online platform welcomes registration of partnerships and voluntary commitments undertaken by Governments, intergovernmental organizations, major groups and other stakeholders that are aligned with SMART deliverables - Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Resource-based, and Time-bound – and that aim to drive the implementation of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals of the 2030 Agenda.	After a registration is submitted, the initiative will be reviewed by the UN secretariat, and if qualified, will be published in the online platform. Registered initiatives are encouraged to maintain up-to-date information and periodically self-report progress once a year through the online platform, focusing on how the initiative has contributed to the achievement of specific goals and targets in the 2030 Agenda.





The SMART criteria
Specific: Registered initiatives should aim for concrete deliverables, contributing to specific goals and targets under the 2030 Agenda. In the case of multi-stakeholder partnerships, each partner should have a clear role to play.
Measurable: To facilitate review of progress, registered initiatives should set measurable progress indicators.
Achievable: Registered initiatives should set attainable goals and strive to deliver results.
Resource-based: Initiatives should have a secured resource base, rather than merely project proposals,
Time-bound: Deliverables should be time-specific.



The November 1981 issue of Management Review contained a paper by George T. Doran called There's a S.M.A.R.T. way to write management's goals and objectives.[1][4] It discussed the importance of objectives and the difficulty of setting them.
Ideally speaking, each corporate, department, and section objective should be:
Specific – target a specific area for improvement.
Measurable – quantify or at least suggest an indicator of progress.
Assignable – specify who will do it.
Realistic – state what results can realistically be achieved, given available resources.
Time-related – specify when the result(s) can be achieved.




Partnership Data for SDGs
The Partnership Data for SDGs (PD4SDGs)7 initiative is a collaboration between the Division for Sustainable Development Goals of UN-DESA, the UN Office for Partnerships and the UN Global Compact, aimed at improving the transparency, accountability and the sharing of experiences of the work being carried out by multi-stakeholder partnerships and voluntary commitments in their support to the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).	The initiative seeks to bring greater transparency, coherence, impact, and comparability of the work carried out by multi-stakeholder partnerships and voluntary commitments by promoting a system- wide use of the established SMART criteria – a partnership/commitment that is Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Resource-based, with clear and Time-based deliverables.	There is a growing trend to collect voluntary commitments and partnerships in support of UN conferences and processes dealing with sustainable development, sometimes with varying degree of associated level of details, which could lead to difficulty in reviewing impact, track progress and conduct in-depth and global comparability analyses on announced commitments and partnerships. It is against this background the Partnership Data for SDGs initiative has been developed.	The initiative is open for all entities within the United Nations that engage with, and promote the work of, multi-stakeholder partnerships and voluntary commitments in driving implementation of the SDGs.

## SDG Impact Standards



The SDG Impact Standards are best practice standards for entities wanting to embed contributing positively to sustainable development and achieving the SDGs into their approach to creating value for themselves and for Stakeholders (people and planet).
They are not reporting standards. They focus on the internal management and decision-making practices that are needed to support more informed and accountable internal decision making and choices in line with achieving the SDGs and other sustainable development outcomes.
The Standards embed the SDGs and the Impact Management Project’s norms as the shared language to understand, manage and communicate impact. The Standards also embed the United Nations Guiding Principles for Business and Human Rights and the Ten Principles of the United Nations Global Compact, to underscore the importance of respect for human rights and other responsible business practices in contributing positively to sustainable development and achieving the SDGs.




Standard 1 (Strategy): Embedding foundational elements into purpose and strategy

Standard 2 (Management Approach): Integrating foundational elements into operations and management approach

Standard 3 (Transparency): Disclosing how foundational elements are integrated into purpose, strategy, management approach and governance, and reporting on performance

Standard 4 (Governance): Reinforcing commitment to foundational elements through governance practices



The SDG Impact Standards aim to help operationalize high level principles of practice in a consistent way and bridge the gap between high level principles of practice and relevant tools and reporting frameworks. The OPIM provides the overarching architecture or principles for best practice within impact management systems. The SDG Impact Standards provide more detailed and specific practice guidance around how organizations develop the internal management and decision making systems to measure and manage impact, consistent with OPIM and other high level principles of practice. The Standards also embed the SDGs and Impact Management Project as the shared language to understand and communicate impact.
OPIM focuses on the management systems specific to the fund being designated as ‘impact’. The SDG Impact Standards provide the building blocks for the management systems for specific funds linking to the SDGs, as well as certain governance practices of the Fund Manager. This includes an organizational commitment to human rights in line with UN Global Compact, the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights, grievance mechanisms, etc.
The SDG Impact Standards aim to provide the building blocks for an internal impact management system that helps organizations make better decisions, and that provides high quality inputs to support consistent reporting and disclosures under multiple external disclosure and reporting frameworks.








SDG Impact Standards for Enterprises
UNDP is pleased to release Version 1.0 of the SDG Impact Standards for Enterprises, following two rounds of public consultation. We are thankful that so many individuals and organizations took the time for thoughtful reflection and comment through the development of the SDG Impact Standards for Enterprises and on both rounds of public consultation. This has had a significant influence on the Standards. Thank you.
We encourage robust feedback and input through the public consultation process, including written responses to the consultation questions and look forward to further feedback from all.

About the SDG Impact Standards
Enterprises and investors increasingly recognize that sustainable development is at the core of long-term value creation but are not yet systematically integrating sustainability and impact considerations in their decision-making. SDG Impact aims to help make this process easier through SDG Impact Standards.
The SDG Impact Standards are practice standards, revolving around internal decision-making, designed to transform how enterprises and investors think about value creation, and integrate impact management and contributing positively to the SDGs in their strategy, management approach, disclosure, and governance practices. Grounded in existing principles, standards and market best practices, the Standards provide context for applying other tools and frameworks, including metrics, taxonomies, and reporting frameworks.
In addition to the Standards for Enterprises, SDG Impact is developing Standards for Bonds Issuers and Standards for Private Equity Funds. SDG Impact also collaborated with the OECD in the development of Impact Standards for Financing Sustainable Development (IS-FSD).

About the Standards for Enterprises
The Standards are for Enterprises committed to contributing positively to sustainable development and towards achieving the SDGs. All Enterprises – irrespective of size, geography, or sector – can use the Standards. This includes publicly listed enterprises, public-interest, and private entities (both for-profit or not-for-profit), non-governmental organizations (NGOs), small and medium enterprises (SMEs), and state-owned or other public-sector entities.
The Standards set out a decision-making framework to help Enterprises integrate impact management into their strategy, management approach, disclosure, governance and decision-making practices. They help Enterprises link their approach to creating long-term, sustainable value for the Enterprise with contributing positively to sustainable development in line with the SDGs. They do this by directing attention and resources to where Enterprises can optimize their contribution by focusing on material positive and negative impacts. Embedding the Standards into management decision-making will strengthen impact performance and facilitate higher quality and more consistent disclosures.

The foundational elements of the Standards are:
contributing positively to sustainable development and achieving the SDGs
which cannot be achieved without demonstrating respect for human rights, planetary boundaries and other responsible business practices
and is realized through effective impact management and decision-making




Standard 1 (Strategy): Embedding foundational elements into purpose and strategy
Standard 2 (Management Approach): Integrating foundational elements into operations and management approach
Standard 3 (Transparency): Disclosing how foundational elements are integrated into purpose, strategy, management approach and governance, and reporting on performance
Standard 4 (Governance): Reinforcing commitment to foundational elements through governance practices



SDG Impact Standards for Enterprises – Enterprise Actions
The Standards are provided to organizations as a ‘best practice’ guide to help them operate more sustainably and optimize their contribution to sustainable development and the SDGs by integrating responsible business and impact management practices into their organizational systems and internal decision-making.

To be Included!
The current procedure that is followed that is considered as an effective analysis of impact:
Determine the change request and check its feasibility in the system 
Identify the sequence to perform a task and how to interrelate it with the current one.
Change is a critical component of product evolution.
Identify the effects of the change request.
Identify the change request’s priority.
Analyze and document the outcome.

Once completed, the impact analysis report must be shared with all stakeholders so that they can determine if they should support the change, or not.



The Importance of Impact Analysis

An Impact Analysis is meant to provide a better overall understanding of the change request and system and reveal potential issues before taking any action.	For example, let us assume a location change is required after an unexpected disaster. In this instance, an impact analysis can help the management understand the true cost of fixing the situation they are in and reveal the best way to move forward.	But Impact analysis can help in making business decisions too. When a company is faced with a major change, an impact analysis can help lend clarity before making impactful decisions.	An Impact Analysis also helps understand the possible outcomes of implementing the change request. By observing outcomes, the user can predict the overall performance of the product after a change is made.	In software, this analysis can help identify all the files, documents, and models that may be affected. Based on this information, the development team may decide to make certain modifications to make the change implementation smoother.
The analysis will also help estimate the effort needed behind implementing the change and identify the tasks required to implement the change properly.



To be included: 
It is not always important to document the analysis in a formal manner with all checkpoints. But a few checkpoints are applicable in showcasing the impact of a change request:
Description of an issue(Change request)
Change request ID
Title
Description
Prepared date
Estimates: This includes relative benefit, relative penalty, relative cost, and relative risk
Estimated total efforts: Time in hrs
Estimated lost efforts: Time in hrs
Estimated Schedule impact: in days
Quality impacted
Another requirement affected
Another task impacted
Integration issues


Requirements changes are a part of the development cycle. The concerned stakeholders coordinate with software engineers to identify the requirements defects, changes, adding new requirements, and requirement prioritizing.
In product development, surprises are rarely good news. Before a developer says, “Sure, no problem” in response to a change request, he or she should spend a little time on impact analysis.
It’s critical to understand the specific set of requirements and features that need to be retested after a change is implemented. Skipping impact analysis doesn’t change the size of the task. It just turns the size into a surprise.

## Data & Statistics

Though environmental statistics is still a relatively new statistical domain, the demand for such statistics is increasing in conjunction with continuing environmental degradation and the obstacles associated with improved environmental management. The recognition that human well-being depends on the environment has led to an increasing list of environmental problems on which decisions must be taken, such as climate change, biodiversity loss and natural resource management. Given the need for governments, businesses, households and other decision makers to deal effectively with these issues, the environment statistics informing them must be of the highest quality possible.
Environment statistics provide information about the state and changes of environmental conditions, the quality and availability of environmental resources, the impact of human activities and natural events on the environment and the impact of changing environmental conditions. They also provide information about the social actions and economic measures that societies take to avoid or mitigate these impacts and to restore and maintain the capacity of the environment to provide the services that are essential for life and human well-being.
Environment statistics thus cover a wide range of information and are multi- and inter- disciplinary in nature. They originate from a variety of institutions that collect data and, similarly, numerous methods are used to compile them. The field of environment statistics requires an appropriate framework to guide its development, coordination and organization. Framework for the Development of Environment Statistics (FDES 2013)
This environment statistics framework (i) marks out the scope of environment statistics; (ii) facilitates a synthesized presentation of data from various subject areas and sources; (iii) simplifies the complexity of the environment appropriately so that it can be measured more easily; (iv) helps to identify the range of statistics relevant to societal decision-making regarding the environment; (v) is consistent with statistical frameworks already used in other domains to facilitate the integration of environment statistics; and (vi) is conceptually based.

Environment statistics serve a variety of users, including but not limited to:
i. Policy and decision makers at all levels;
ii. The general public, including media and civil society;
iii. Analysts, researchers and academia; and
iv. International agencies.
1.7. Different users need environment statistics at different levels of aggregation and depths of information. They may need cross-cutting environment statistics data sets, for instance regarding climate change. In other cases, they may be interested only in particular topics and themes pertaining to specific sectoral analysis and policymaking. Policy- and decision-makers at the highest levels and the general public would tend to use environmental indicators and more aggregated statistics. Environmental administration, researchers, analysts and academics may be more inclined to examine extensive and detailed environment statistics. International agencies typically have well-articulated needs for environment statistics based on environmental agreements or international data collection processes.
Overview of Environment Statistics—Characteristics and Challenges 7
1.8. Environment statistics support evidence-based policymaking by making it possible to identify environmental policy issues and quantify the measures and impacts of policy initiatives objectively. They strengthen assessments through quantitative metrics, making analyses more robust through the use of timely and comparable data. The type; level of thematic, spatial and temporal aggregation; and format of environment statistics depend on the type of user and intended use. The main products of environment statistics are detailed tabulated environment statistics series and environmental indicators, both of which can be stored in multipurpose databases and disseminated in the form of online databases, as well as different types of publications, such as compendiums, yearbooks, thematic reports, and analytical publications, such as state of the environment reports.
1.4. Environmental information, data, statistics and indicators
1.9. Environmental information includes quantitative and qualitative facts describing the state of the environment and its changes. Quantitative environmental information is generally produced in the form of data, statistics and indicators, and is generally disseminated through databases, spreadsheets, compendiums and yearbooks. Qualitative environmental information consists of descriptions (e.g., textual or pictorial) of the environment or its constituent parts that cannot be adequately represented by accurate quantitative descriptors.
1.10. Environmental data are large amounts of unprocessed observations and measurements about the environment and related processes. They may be collected or compiled via statistical surveys (censuses or sample surveys) by the national statistical system or may originate from administrative records, geographic databases, registers, inventories, monitoring networks, thematic mapping, remote sensing, scientific research and field studies.
1.11. Environment statistics are environmental data that have been structured, synthesized and aggregated according to statistical methods, standards and procedures. The role of environment statistics is to process environmental and other data into meaningful statistics that describe the state of and trends in the environment and the main processes affecting them. Not all environmental data are used to produce environment statistics. The FDES provides a frame- work that identifies environmental and other data that fall within its scope and then contributes to structuring, synthesizing and aggregating the data into statistical series and indicators.
1.12. Environmental indicators are environment statistics that have been selected for their ability to depict important phenomena or dynamics. Environmental indicators are used to synthesize and present complex environment and other statistics in a simple, direct, clear and relevant way. Environmental indicators are generated because environment statistics are usually too numerous and detailed to meet the needs of policymakers and the general public, and often require further processing and interpretation to be meaningful. Environmental indica- tors may take various forms such as rates, ratios or proportions, and be constructed at different levels of aggregation. The purpose of these indicators is to assess present and future directions with respect to goals and targets, evaluate and determine the impact of specific programs, monitor progress, measure changes in a specific condition or situation over time, and con- vey messages. Policy frameworks such as the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the Driving force-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) framework and national environment/sustainable development indicator sets, are typically used to identify and structure indicators.
1.13. Environmental indices are composite or more complex measures that combine and synthesize more than one environmental indicator or statistic and are weighted according to different methods. An index can provide a valuable summary measure to communicate important messages in an accessible way and, thus, raise awareness. However, they often raise questions regarding their proper interpretation, methodological soundness, subjectivity of the weighting, and the quality of the underlying statistics.
1.14. Environment statistics organized primarily within the FDES may be structured for specific analytical purposes based on different analytical frameworks, such as the DPSIR framework, issue-based frameworks which focus on specific environmental problems (e.g., climate change, air pollution and land degradation), policy-based frameworks such as sus- tainable development strategies, or assessment frameworks such as those used in state of the environment reports.
1.15. Accounting frameworks, such as the SEEA, reorganize the relevant environment statistics according to stocks and flows within and between the environment and the economy, based on the principles of the System of National Accounts (SNA). In this way, it creates links between environment statistics and the SNA and facilitates the analysis of relationships between the economy and the environment.
1.16. These types of environment statistics are all important and interdependent. They feed back into each other to produce diverse and complementary products that can be used for different purposes and that fit specific user needs and resources of countries or agencies. Ideally, information about the environment should be produced and used as a multipurpose information system which would increase synergy, consistency and efficiency in the use of limited financial resources.
1.5. Sources of environment statistics
1.17. Environment statistics synthesize data originating from various types of sources. Thus, the data used to produce environment statistics are not only compiled by different collection techniques, but also by various institutions. Types of sources include:
i. statistical surveys (e.g., censuses or sample surveys of population, housing, agriculture, enterprises, households, employment, and different aspects of environment management);
ii. administrative records of government and non-government agencies responsible for natural resources, as well as other ministries and authorities;
iii. remote sensing and thematic mapping (e.g., satellite imaging and mapping of land use and land cover, water bodies or forest cover);
iv. monitoring systems (e.g., field-monitoring stations for water quality, air pollution or climate);
v. scientific research and special projects undertaken to fulfill domestic or international demand.
1.18.
mating certain types of emissions to the air, statistical surveys are used in combination with scientific research. While statistical surveys and administrative records are commonly used in all areas of statistics (economic, social and environment) and the use of remote sensing data has become widespread, the use of data from monitoring networks, scientific research and special projects are specific mostly to the production of environment statistics.
1.19. Environment statistics rely considerably on data that are collected by direct measurements using a variety of methods, including remote sensing and field-monitoring stations.

Most countries have agencies that are primarily responsible for monitoring environmental resources and conditions. They may be entities in their own right or government agencies with other primary functions that also have departments concerned with environmental matters. These agencies typically produce two main types of data: (i) measured data (obtained by direct observation, field measurements and remote sensing); and (ii) calculated data (derived using estimates and modeling).
1.20. The use of estimates and modeling to generate environmental data can improve overall data quality, including accuracy and coverage, especially when models draw upon two or more sets of observations, such as field observations coupled with global satellite-based observations. Models may also incorporate administrative data or data resulting from statistical surveys or special projects.
1.21. The main characteristics, advantages and disadvantages of these types of sources of environment statistics are discussed below.6

Overview of Environment Statistics—Characteristics and Challenges

Global Data Structure Definition
The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development underscores the national ownership of the SDGs and calls for “data which is high-quality, accessible, timely, reliable and disaggregated by income, sex, age, race, ethnicity, migration status, disability and geographic location and other characteristics relevant in national contexts.” Consequently, while the global SDG DSD sets a standard for global reporting, the Member States must be able to customize the DSD to suit its own national circumstances, in particular extend it with national indicators and disaggregation. This document outlines recommendations and guidance on how to customize the DSD.

Fundamental principles of official statistics 

Official statistics should be a cornerstone of a modern society by providing an unbiased and accurate picture of the economic, demographic, social and environmental situation and development in a country. To an increasing degree, high quality and comparable statistics are also important for analysis and decision-making at the international and global level. Thus, it is essential that official statistics can be trusted by all users and stakeholders and are made accessible and understandable for all users.
A great deal of statistics is also being produced by private and public agencies that are not part of the system of official statistics. Statistics of questionable quality and proper documentation can be potentially confusing and lead to distrust of the national statistical office (NSO) which is supposed to produce unbiased and high-quality official statistics. Therefore, it is of utmost importance that those statistics considered to be ‘official’ follow strict and well-defined principles and standards.

The European Statistics Code of Practice (ESS CoP) contains, among other things, specific principles and guidance relevant to the dissemination of the statistics. The ESS CoP lays down specific requirements for clarifying the statistical outputs, their regularity, timeliness, and how they are released. All NSOs and other producers of official statistics within the European Statistical System follow and respect these requirements.
Recommended international practice reinforced by ESS CoP and dissemination standards discussed above, require NSOs and other producers of official statistics to publish metadata on their statistics along with the statistics themselves. Most NSOs strive to compile product metadata, at least that pertaining to the statistics most used, and publish them on the web.
NSOs publish their statistics in aggregate form, thereby seeking to ensure the confidentiality of the data providers and the subjects they refer to. There is, however, substantial demand for microdata for research purposes. Several NSOs have in recent years started to release or grant access to microdata to researchers. For some years, some NSOs have been preparing a specific set of microdata for research, initially to be handed over to recognised researchers, more recently for release on the web. The data set has then been prepared specifically for such use by anonymisation, i.e., removing identifiers of individuals, households, and businesses, and removing variables that would have allowed indirect identification. Some NSOs have also granted on-line access to such microdata for research. Granting access to microdata is usually also accompanied by documentation signed by the researcher specifying the datasets that are made available, the purpose of use of the data, the safeguarding of the data as well as a pledge to respect rules of statistical confidentiality and the privacy of respondents. Granting access to microdata for research purposes entails a significant addition to the utilisation of the data and the value of the statistical production.

Ocean makes it easy to publish data services (deploy and mint ERC20 datatokens), and to consume data services (spend datatokens). Crypto wallets, exchanges, and DAOs become data wallets, exchanges, and DAOs. Use Ocean Market to publish data, stake on data (curate), and buy data. Earn by selling, staking, or running your own fork of Ocean Market. Data has automatic price discovery. Data is published as interoperable ERC20 datatokens. Compute-to-data enables private data to be bought & sold. It's a decentralized exchange (DEX), tuned for data. Earn by selling data, staking, or building & launching your own marketplace. Sellers get most of revenue when a dataset is sold. Stakers earn a % of the transaction fee, as do marketplace runners.



Data standards United Nations 

In the discussions that have taken place since, the principle of data interoperability has been added to the above. It is defined as ensuring that systems are using the same set of definitions, classifications and methodology, as well as technologically compatible platforms allowing for full harmonization of interfaces and access protocols 

The principle of data disaggregation underpins the data requirements of the Leave no one behind promise of the 2030 Agenda. The other key principles precisely pinpoint critical challenges in meeting these requirements.
Statistical organizations have been discussing at the sessions of the United Nations Statistical Commission (UNSC), either in special-topic forums or as part of work under the formal agenda, what these principles mean for national statistical offices and national statistical systems.


ISO20022

ISO 20022 is an ISO standard for electronic data interchange between financial institutions. It describes a metadata repository containing descriptions of messages and business processes, and a maintenance process for the repository content. The standard covers financial information transferred between financial institutions that includes payment transactions, securities trading and settlement information, credit and debit card transactions and other financial information.
The repository contains a huge amount of financial services metadata that has been shared and standardized across the industry. The metadata is stored in UML models with a special ISO 20022 UML Profile. Underlying all of this is the ISO 20022 metamodel - a model of the models. The UML profile is the metamodel transformed into UML. The metadata is transformed into the syntax of messages used in financial networks. The first syntax supported for messages was XML Schema.

## Quality Assurance


Quality” is the degree to which a set of inherent characteristics of an object fulfills requirements.7 In the context of statistical organizations, and in this Manual, the object is the statistical output or product, the process, the institutional environment or the whole statistical system. A simple definition of quality is “fit for use” or “fit for purpose”. It is the users’ needs that define the quality. Different users may have different needs that must be balanced against each other to provide the quality concept with concrete content. Over the past 20 years, statistical agencies have arrived at the consensus that the concept of “quality of statistical information” is multidimensional, and that there is no one single measure of quality. For a statistical product, the general definition of quality is operationalized by specifying a set of factors or dimensions that characterize it: relevance; accuracy and reliability; timeliness and punctuality; accessibility and clarity; and coherence and comparability. The dimensions of quality are interrelated, and there are trade-offs between some of
See International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 9000:2015.
Content and use of the Manual 3
United Nations National Quality Assurance Frameworks Manual for Official Statistics
There are different relevant ISO standards for quality and other management areas; in addition to covering quality manage- ment, including customer satis- faction, they comprise market, opinion and social research and risk management.
The Deming Prize Committee, revised 1998.
The various quality assurance frameworks cover the same or similar aspects of statistical quality. Some are referred to as codes of practice, stressing their normative character. Adequate management of each of them is essential. At the same time, they must be seen in relation to each other within the statistical production processes.
Quality management frameworks and quality management. Quality man- agreement frameworks provide a coherent and holistic system as a basis for quality management (see definition in section 1.C.). There are various general quality management frameworks applicable to any organization, such as total quality management, International Organization for Standardization (ISO),8 Six Sigma, European Foundation for Quality Management, Balanced Scorecard, Lean and Lean Six Sigma. These frameworks are largely based on common definitions and principles, but their main focus and formalization vary. For example, ISO emphasizes certification and standardization of “processes”, while Six Sigma focuses on quality control of the “products/ outputs” using statistical methods. Lean emphasizes improvement in efficiency by reducing waste.
In many ways, total quality management, which was developed in the previous century, is the foundation of all general quality frameworks. Total quality management is defined as “a set of systematic activities carried out by the entire organization to effectively and efficiently achieve company objectives so as to provide products and services with a level of quality that satisfies customers, at the appropriate time and price”.9 The strategic core of all major total quality management models is continuous improvement, often illustrated with reference to the “Plan-Do-Check- Act” cycle made popular by W. Edwards Deming. This cycle is a four-step process that guides all changes for continuous improvement.
Statistical quality frameworks. The above-mentioned general quality frameworks inspired statistical quality frameworks such as the European Statistics Code of Practice, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Data Quality Assessment Framework, the Recommendation of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Council on Good Statistical Practice and the UN-NQAF presented in chapter 3.10 These are also inspired by and consistent with the Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics, which emphasize independence, impartiality and the protection of data of individuals. Such requirements of official statistics were first formulated jointly in the Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics in 1992.
Purpose of an NQAF .An NQAF provides a coherent and holistic system for statistical quality management that assures trust in and the quality of official statistics. The UN-NQAF presented in chapter 3 contains the components that should be considered in managing and assuring the quality of official statistics.
Benefits. The main benefits of having an NQAF for official statistics are as follows:
- It provides a generic model for the members of the NSS to adopt, develop or revisit their own quality assurance framework;
- It offers a mechanism for the systematic monitoring and ongoing identification of risks and quality issues across the NSS to develop timely corrective measures. It therefore supports quality improvements and their maintenance over time;
- It supports NSS coordination by providing common guidance on quality assurance and reference materials for training;
- It gives greater transparency to the processes by which quality is assured and reinforces the credibility of statistics producers and the coordinating agency (typically the NSO) within the NSS;
- It serves as a common ground to promote dialogue on quality challenges and opportunities at the national, regional and international levels;

Content and use of the Manual 5 (f) It provides a basis for creating and maintaining a culture of quality within the NSS.
Quality management and risk management. Risk management has many similarities with quality management. The approach is a bit different, but risk and quality management frameworks are not mutually exclusive—they are complementary. The implementation of risk-based thinking is one of the requirements of ISO 9001:2015. Risk management itself is guided by the framework of the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Risk and quality management should not operate independently of each other. A coordinated approach is cost- effective and facilitates the involvement and support of management (see chapter 4 for further information).

Recommendation 1, together with recommendations 2 to 5, form the overarching core recommendations that, if implemented, establish the basis for quality assurance for official statistics in a country. Recommendation 1 is directly derived from two existing resolutions of the General Assembly on statistics.22 Recommendations 2 to 5 are largely based on principle 1 of the Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics, which states that official statistics should meet the test of practical utility. Practical utility is defined as “fitness for use” or “fitness for purpose”, which is the definition of data quality.
Recommendation 1: It is recommended that, in order to be effective, the fundamental values and principles that govern the development, production and dissemination of official statistics be guaranteed by legal and institutional frame- works and be respected at all political levels and by all stakeholders in national statistical systems.
Recommendation 2: It is recommended that countries include the requirements of quality assurance in their national statistical legislation and other legislation mandating the production of statistics for official use (derived from principle 1 of the Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics).23
Recommendation 3: It is recommended that countries establish a national quality assurance framework for official statistics and that all members of the national statistical system commit to continually assessing, improving and reporting on the quality of official statistics, as well as on the quality of data and statistics used in the production of official statistics as required24 (derived from principle 1 of the Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics).
Recommendation 4: It is recommended that the national quality assurance framework for official statistics be developed in consideration or in alignment with the United Nations National Quality Assurance Framework or similar existing quality assurance frameworks (derived from principles 1 and 2 of the Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics).
Recommendation 5: It is recommended that the national quality assurance framework be implemented at the national statistical office and throughout the entire national statistical system. Furthermore, it is recommended that the national quality assurance framework be applied to all data and statistics produced outside of the national statistical system that are disseminated with the help and support of a member of the national statistical system or that are used for government decision-making, as deemed appropriate and required (derived from principle 1 of the Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics).

Recommendations that aim at the implementation of specific Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics. The following recommendations provide an interpretation of the Principles to facilitate their implementation and to stress their importance in the context of statistical quality assurance, as the Principles provide the normative basis for official statistics. The recommendations may be incorporated into a country’s statistical laws, as appropriate, to assure adherence to the Principles.
Recommendations 6 to 14 are either directly derived from one or two of the Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics or are a repetition of a specific principle. The Principles and the associated recommendations of the present chapter support specific principles contained in the UN-NQAF and give them an obligatory character (see chapter 3, which contains references to the applicable Principles).
Recommendation 6: In accordance with principles 1 and 2 of the Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics, it is recommended that statistics at all lev- els, including the local level, be planned, designed, developed, produced and disseminated on an impartial basis, and according to strictly professional considerations.
Recommendation 7: In accordance with principle 3 of the Fundamental Princi- ples of Official Statistics, it is recommended that statistics and data be presented in a way that facilitates their correct interpretation, which implies that appro- priate metadata, such as that relating to data sources, methods and procedures used, be made available in conjunction with the released data or statistics.
Recommendation 8: In accordance with principle 4 of the Fundamental Prin- ciples of Official Statistics, it is recommended that all members of the national statistical system comment on erroneous interpretation and misuse of official statistics in their respective subject-matter domain(s) of statistical production and dissemination, as required.
Recommendation 9: In accordance with principles 1 and 5 of the Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics, it is recommended that countries include in their statistical laws: (a) the mandate of producers of official statistics to collect needed information to compile statistics directly from respondents if it is not already available in the national statistical system and cannot be obtained from existing data; and (b) the entitlement to select data sources based on professional consid- erations, including “new” sources such as big data.
Recommendation 10: In accordance with principle 6 of the Fundamental Prin- ciples of Official Statistics, it is recommended that individual data collected by statistical agencies for statistical compilation, whether they refer to natural or legal persons, be kept strictly confidential and used exclusively for statistical purposes.
Recommendation 11: In accordance with principle 7 of the Fundamental Princi- ples of Official Statistics, it is recommended that the laws, regulations and meas- ures under which the national statistical systems operate be made public.
Recommendation 12: In accordance with principle 8 of the Fundamental Prin- ciples of Official Statistics, it is recommended that the work of the national sta- tistical system be properly coordinated to achieve consistency and efficiency, and that, therefore, the statistical law of the country: (a) clearly identifies the roles and responsibilities of the individual members within the national statistical system; and (b) establishes a body that is responsible for managing and coordi- nating system-wide activities, including promotion of the national quality assur- ance framework.

Recommendations 13: In accordance with principle 9 of the Fundamental Prin- ciples of Official Statistics, it is recommended that the national statistical office and all other members of the national statistical system, including members at the local level, use international statistical concepts, classifications and methods, thereby ensuring the consistency of official statistics and the efficiency of statisti- cal systems at all levels.
Recommendation 14: In accordance with principle 10 of the Fundamental Prin- ciples of Official Statistics, it is recommended that countries participate in bilat- eral and multilateral cooperation in statistics to improve official statistics in all countries.


## The Platform

The purpose of the platform has been described already, yet here you’ll find a thoroughly descriptive version containing everything you need to know when interacting with the platform. 
The purpose of the Mpowa platform is to connect the world and its issues to the right community of people who desire to make a swift impact without having to go through organizational hassles themselves. 


Market Mechanism

Through tokenization of carbon offset we enhance the capacities for the carbon offset market through providing specific individual proof-of-offset which will mitigate double-spending issues. 
 The funds that Mpowa, and its platform participants, will acquire through selling (tokenized) carbon offset credits, shall partially function as a means to kickstart new projects and decrease the timeframe in which the project can be successfully  realized.   Our Mpowa-Solvatten project-based NFT’s will be carrying a legitimate and tradable certificate of ownership of the specific carbon offset tokens and data tokens, linked to the specific serial number of a water-purification device, that is manufactured Solvatten.

Through Tokenization of carbon offset we enhance the capacities for the carbon offset market through providing specific individual proof-of-offset which will mitigate double-spending issues.


 The Decarbonizer-Application contains a non-custodial wallet for cryptocurrency-tokens (+ purchasing options), users’ impactor-profile, Mpowa’s current and upcoming projects and an investor-leaderboard. For each impactor-type there are additional features that come with it that will be described later in this paper.

Participants can purchase project-based NFT’s in a separate marketplace, to directly fund a project of their preference, and receive additional benefits. The marketplace will contain a unique NFT-Builder function to mint tokens accordingly depending on what regional demands are at a current moment in time.

Through research, suggestions will be given to marketplace participants in terms of necessity of projects. If there’s a higher necessity for a certain NFT-kit to be minted or a higher participation rate (meaning the project will be realized sooner), implementing those suggestions in your NFT-Mint will result into receiving a larger amount of Impact Tokens, because Carbon Offset profits will be generated sooner than later, and logically, the impact will happen sooner. 

The NFT’s purchased in the mentioned marketplace will be transferred to your Decarbonizer-App Wallet, alongside the Impact Tokens. Specific traits and additional information regards your Impact-Certificate will be available off-chain outside the application. If mGOV tokens are assigned to a specific project, these represents your share in the project and rights in the DAO that is created for the specific project.

The platform application is directly linked to the project marketplace, which lists all the different projects that Mpowa is currently running. This marketplace is also accessible from outside the application, on a delegated website, and can directly interact with the same Mpowa-Wallet. 

Each project will contain a brief and extensive description, depending on what the participant desires to view, alongside a progression bar to see how far along the funding is for a certain project and all the partners that are working with Mpowa to make the project come to realization.

The utility tokens can be purchased manually on the Mpowa-Website and through the mobile application, with both fiat and cryptocurrencies. Once the project has liquidity that is provided for a specific projects is locked until the project comes to realization, when the funds will be assigned to the parties involved after completing their work and getting sufficient approval from the DAO that they did so, or when the necessary funds to launch the project are not raised before a specific date - in which case the utility tokens will be refunded to everyone who has purchased an NFT to participate in the project.

In order to participate on the Mpowa platform, each costumer has to follow the necessary KYC-protocols, including which will be described on our platform website and application. The services we use for KYC, AML and CTF are GDPR-compliant. 
The various tokens that are interconnected through the Mpowa platform will be thoroughly described in this paper, with all containing ‘decentralized’ governance properties. Providing decentralized governance is a means to allow for effective, legitimate and transparent interaction and transaction. 


Tokens are used by smart contracts to manage the ownership rights (and duties) of a contract. The downside of smart contracts is the ongoing costs of operating the service, but these costs are much, much cheaper than alternative/traditional means.


Before the Project Hero hands over the Solvatten device to the recipient family in Gambia, we have them sign an agreement in which they promise to declare usage data through our app. The application will stream the usage data to the Mpowa blockchain which will be picked up by the Mpowa-CarbonToken-Minting Contract and initiate a tokenMint according to the incoming data which will be deposited in a central Mpowa-Co2-offset wallet, which then will be equally distributed to the Value-Token holders.


After downloading the app, and before you can use electricity, you create a user account (or login, if you have an account already). The app guides you through the onboarding and KYC process. After completing this, you’re ready to load Tokens onto your account.
The Mpowa infrastructure will contain a costumer interface which is capable of monitoring the energy generation and distribution back to the grid in real-time. The energy that is being generated will be tokenized which links a specific source device to which a device-specific NFT (which is registered on the EWC through EW-DOS) is assigned. Other meta data concerning the environment and operation of the unit will also be stored on-chain.	The generated Energy Tokens will be priced in real-time via EWC, converted and magnetized through a DEX and resulting Mpowa utility tokens will be stored in a wallet app on the MPOWA network. The DEX will in effect source liquidity from the purchaser of the tokens (Utility Company and/or Grid Operator) custodial account to purchase the Mpowa tokens.	As a secondary stretch goal, the DEX will generate carbon offset data tokens against a pre-configured NFT token smart contract that is associated to the device registration on the Energy Web. The methodology and formulas for how this offset is to be calculated will need to be specified and provided to Mpowa by IGES SMEs. As a concrete objective, Mpowa wishes to create a generalized framework for accurate, data driven (AI/ML based) pricing of carbon by defining an open standard which takes into account all known reference models as a “floor price” but adds in a (always net positive) market adjustment for various factors based on data sourced from the climate data warehouse. An outcome of the project will be to publish a joint white paper on this model and have this peer reviewed by stakeholders at the CCC and CDW.	The Mpowa platform connects a wide variety of technologies to a single decentralized digitally tokenized energy ecosystem, be that domestic consumers, electric vehicle drivers, businesses or even individual electronic devices like mobile phones, laptops, tablets.
	The Platform manages and connects all Mpowa Energy Units to the blockchain, where supply and consumption are logged and controlled. Energy is tokenized and price is pegged to a stablecoin to counter volatility. The Mpowa infrastructure will contain a costumer interface which is capable of monitoring the energy generation and distribution back to the grid in real-time. The Mpowa participants (the “MPOWA’ers”) will be able to use clean, infinite, reliable low-cost energy, produced through the MPOWA’s devices, payable in tokens, and that generates data that can only be monetised by the owner. Mpowa is developing a number of tokens for our DAO ecosystem including a Utility token, Security token, Data token and Governance token for the management of the platform.



A disruptive new Blockchain-based Application that empowers users to have an impact by financing clean-tech projects and become part of a collective force developing a decentralized, autonomous organization that facilitates the transition towards resource abundance. 
Our dApp has an integrated wallet that will represent your Mpowa Utility Tokens, Project Tokens and Data tokens.
You can purchase tokens with credit-card or other supported payment methods. Tokens will be loaded onto your account after payment, and you can then immediately use them to invest in projects of interest, and eventually consume energy.

As a new user, you will be asked to select your role within the platform environment. For now, let us start with the IMPACTOR profile, which is focussed on participation by the public. An IMPACTOR holds a critical role in funding the right projects and ensuring that the initiative stays true to its mission and purpose. Whilst empowering the public to participate in the transition towards a sustainable future. 
An IMPACTOR navigates through different projects, investigate the details, and facilitate the finance though the MPOWA-tokens, which can be tracked for complete TRANSPARENCY and TRUST. The entire experience is gamified to increase the level of participation, motivation and inclusion. 

Prospective partnership with acknowledged CTX Global Carbon Credit Exchange facilitate the platform-subscribers with a reward mechanism. The Carbon Offset that is generated through a specific Mpowa clean-tech project, will be listed in Carbon Credits on the CTX Global for purchase by SME’s and larger corporate organizations to reduce their Carbon Footprint. The profits that are generated by Mpowa for selling Carbon Credits will be forwarded to the reward-pool on the exchange where the Mpowa Security Token is listed. Rewards are allocated on to the stakeholders of a project as a reward for providing initial liquidity to enable the project to occur.
For the pilot project the profits of the Carbon offset sale are not redirected to 

The platform utilizes blockchain technology as a payment system to enable international participation, due to regulatory compliance, low transaction fees and instant transactions. Besides serving as a payment mechanism, we use the Mpowa Blockchain transactions as a transport layer for information exchange. The Mpowa Blockchain, a database, is a distributed ledger of trusted transactions. 	In addition to serving as a mechanism for payments and information the technology works as a value exchange protocol. It’s similar to TCP/IP as the foundational protocol for the exchange of digital information. Blockchain enables the exchange of digital value and digital representations of real-world value-backed assets. The Mpowa platform makes use of project/object based Non-Fungible-Tokens, representing a specific clean-tech device and the costs that come alongside it, may it be for a project or for personal use. Each NFT is linked to a certificate of ownership, which carries certain rights and obligations in the DAO, and KYC information. Another feature of our project-based NFT’s, is that they contain ownership-rights to tokenized representations of Carbon Offset Credits, which are minted upon data-retrieval. For the pilot project we will launch a token-sale to spark the funding for platform and the project. The project-based NFT’s will be listed on an NFT-Marketplace where costumers can purchase their share in a specific project. The assets available on the NFT-Marketplace can also be purchased through our platform App, which then will be stored in their Mpowa-Wallet. If one wishes to sell their NFT, they can do so by requesting a re-listing of their specific NFT on the NFT-Marketplace.

A smart contract is a dynamic contract that is managed by an autonomous agent (off-chain representative) using the Access Controls. The smart contract operates on behalf of the issuer for all administrative tasks associated with maintaining and updating the contract's on-chain records. The smart contract service is responsible for monitoring data that effect the state of the smart contract and for incorporating those changes into the contract. The smart contract can also work with other autonomous agents working on behalf of the issuer or other contracting parties to fully automate all the various processes and tasks associated with the formation and performance of a contract. 

Dynamic contracts typically undergo regular amendments to account for the transfer, change or exercise of ownership rights/duties of the contracting parties, as well as other associated administrative tasks. The use of software and distributed ledgers provides an opportunity to improve the administration, monitoring and performance of these types of contracts.

Tokens are used by smart contracts to manage the ownership rights (and duties) of a contract. The downside of smart contracts is the ongoing costs of operating the service, but these costs are much, much cheaper than alternative/traditional means.

We present a simpler way for people to understand and interact with blockchain. Some of the benefits of utilizing smart contracts on a blockchain are: 
Reducing or complete avoidance of intermediary and overall project, 
Maximized transparency of cost, time and scope of project, 
Limited complexity enabling informed decision making, 
Efficient resolution of contractual gray areas.
 
Smart contracts are aiming to revolutionize many industries by replacing the need for both traditional legal agreements and centrally automated digital agreements. Both performance verification and execution rely on manual actions from one of the contracting parties, or an automated system that programmatically retrieves and updates relevant changes. Unfortunately, because of their underlying consensus protocols, the blockchains on which smart contracts run cannot support native communication with external systems. In this paper we present Mpowa, a decentralize governance token. On Mpowa Platform we describe our components for providing governance token to gain effective, legitimate and transparent transaction.

A smart contract is a dynamic contract that uses an autonomous agent to improve the utility of the contracting experience. The smart contract enforces the rules (T&C’s) of the contract and allows for tools to issue, exchange, govern and enforce ownership rights and duties with respect to the T&C’s and the laws the contract is subject to. The smart contract described in the Tokenized protocol uses the Bitcoin ledger to store all records relevant to the contract.

Tokens are used by smart contracts to manage the ownership rights (and duties) of a contract. The downside of smart contracts is the ongoing costs of operating the service, but these costs are much, much cheaper than alternative/traditional means.

An organization represented by rules encoded as a computer program that is transparent, controlled by the organization members and not influenced by a central government. 
A DAO's financial transaction record and program rules are maintained on a blockchain.  The precise legal status of this type of business organization is unclear. 
The Mpowa Platform is a revolutionary new concept. A physical self powering blockchain ecosystem which monetizes free energy in the form of tokens, is self funded by its community and operates as a true exponential DAO.	
Our platform is the core of the magic. The  Mpowa Energy Units connect to the platform which manages the tokenization of the energy. After getting online, the unit becomes available for use. The user installs a simple app from the AppStore or PlayStore and creates an account. After registration, the user receives some tokens for first use. Using the app, the QR code on the unit is scanned, and the unit (or socket on the unit) is unlocked. After plugging in an appliance, the tokens get consumed as the user draws electricity rom the unit. If the tokens run out, the user can buy new tokens in the app using a credit card or other payment methods. The energy tokens are not tied to your name, and can be transferred between users.
A similar method is used for our pilot project where recipients of the Solvatten Unit have to login our their data-monitoring app where they manually declare their usage and receive tokens in accordance to the amount of water that has been purified with the device.







Long-term Platform vision 

After downloading the app, and before you can use electricity, you create a user account (or login, if you have an account already). The app guides you through the onboarding and KYC process. After completing this, you’re ready to load Tokens onto your account.
The Mpowa infrastructure will contain a costumer interface which is capable of monitoring the energy generation and distribution back to the grid in real-time. The energy that is being generated will be tokenized which links a specific source device to which a device-specific NFT (which is registered on the EWC through EW-DOS) is assigned. Other meta data concerning the environment and operation of the unit will also be stored on-chain.	The generated Energy Tokens will be priced in real-time via EWC, converted and magnetized through a DEX and resulting Mpowa utility tokens will be stored in a wallet app on the Steroid 4.0 network. The DEX will in effect source liquidity from the purchaser of the tokens (Utility Company and/or Grid Operator) custodial account to purchase the Mpowa tokens.	As a secondary stretch goal, the DEX will generate carbon offset data tokens against a pre-configured NFT token smart contract that is associated to the device registration on the Energy Web. The methodology and formulas for how this offset is to be calculated will need to be specified and provided to Mpowa by IGES SMEs. As a concrete objective, Mpowa wishes to create a generalized framework for accurate, data driven (AI/ML based) pricing of carbon by defining an open standard which takes into account all known reference models as a “floor price” but adds in a (always net positive) market adjustment for various factors based on data sourced from the climate data warehouse. An outcome of the project will be to publish a joint white paper on this model and have this peer reviewed by stakeholders at the CCC and CDW.	The Mpowa platform connects a wide variety of technologies to a single decentralized digitally tokenized energy ecosystem, be that domestic consumers, electric vehicle drivers, businesses or even individual electronic devices like mobile phones, laptops, tablets.

	The Platform manages and connects all Mpowa Energy Units to the blockchain, where supply and consumption are logged and controlled. Energy is tokenized and price is pegged to a stablecoin to counter volatility. The Mpowa infrastructure will contain a costumer interface which is capable of monitoring the energy generation and distribution back to the grid in real-time. The Mpowa participants (the “MPOWA’ers”) will be able to use clean, infinite, reliable low-cost energy, produced through the MPOWA’s devices, payable in tokens, and that generates data that can only be monetised by the owner. Mpowa is developing a number of tokens for our DAO ecosystem including a Utility token, Security token, Data token and Governance token for the management of the platform.








## Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)



### Responsibility






### Governance Model




- Properties & Parameters!!



 Mpowa’s platform and tokens pairs with a blockchain based DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization), which gives the users control and transparency. Mpowa’s native blockchain is constructed using Parity Technology’s Substrate framework, elaborated upon in the chapter “The Technology”.
Several years after Bitcoin was launched, DAOs became a useful mechanism developers and adopters to work together in a harmonized and democratic way. The tech represents financial sovereignty and a digital data-currency instrument, thus Bitcoin opened up countless opportunities. Opportunities and innovative ideas find a ground wherein they can gather resources in a creative way to bring projects to life. DAOs promised to revolutionize how we structure socio-economic relationships. Facilitating solutions for ancient problems is where the DAO comes in, due to the (decentralized) power of many. Now the question arrises: Key features and benefits of a DAO-structure- The ability to structure large-scale, merit-based communities with minimal entrance barriers, factor in externalities, and – much in the Bitcoin spirit – break free from relying on traditional institutions. 
- Organize and coordinate the efforts and resources of members via an a priori estimate, anonymous but formalized, and transparent set of rules that are agreed upon in a multilateral fashion.
Usually, one of the core elements of any definition of a DAO is the notion of “decentralization”. This often talked about, yet poorly understood concept is avoided as it warrants a more detailed analysis on its own.
Within the crypto-verse, the term “decentralization” either refers to the physical distribution of hardware (think: validating nodes & full nodes) or the diffusion of political influence. In this case, the latter is relevant. Instead of having a classical hierarchical power distribution, the common approach of any DAO is to foster coordination on a peer-to-peer basis. This element can be described as a multilateral decision-making process.
The second major component of any DAO is “autonomy”, which can be best described by the ability to govern itself.
This ability to be self-governed arises from using smart contracts to stipulate software encoded “rules of the game” for any given DAO. Accordingly, a DAO is governed by an a priori binding, formalized, and transparent set of rules. The respective smart contracts may execute organizational functions in an automated manner, irrespective of the involvement or absence of any other party.
The autonomy of any DAO could thus be generalized as “the degree to which smart contracts govern activity”.
When adopting a new institutional economics perspective, it is possible to describe all activities by value streams. This description is especially apt for a transactional ecosystem that is not based on (interpersonal) trust. The ability of a DAO to initiate value streams - i.e., to act and therefore be autonomous - thus hinges on the ability to allocate and manage resources (i.e., funds). The autonomy of any DAO is consequently inherently linked to the DAO’s direct control over resources.
By focusing on what is governed by multilateral agreements and how a DAO exerts control over resources, these first two components are foremost defining the scope of any DAO.
Besides the scope, there must be an eventual consensus on how to act within this “multilaterally agreed upon autonomy”. Essentially the question is: how can a DAO decide over what components it has control?
In order to answer this question, some deliberation and a subsequent decision-making process must be present.
The deliberation must formalize some agreed-upon discussion process, which could be either discretionary or rule-based. Usually, discussed upon proposals are subsequently voted on. By definition, this voting process has to be conducted on-chain, as it would otherwise not be possible to have certainty about rule adherence.

Generally, the only way to bootstrap this organizational form - the DAO - is by using decentralized ledger technology that is capable of executing smart contracts. Contractual arrangements also protect the involved parties against contract breaches by providing means of retaliation that go as far as to state coercion. Unlike smart contracts, they can, however, not restrict the scope of eligible action a priori by testing requests against business validation rules and thus render (smart) contract breaches impossible.


Resource management
As sketched out earlier, resource management matters, as it profoundly impacts the autonomy of any DAO.
The exclusive usage of on-chain resources allows a DAO to directly exert control and initiate action via a smart contract that may or may not be upgradeable. Depending on the exact set-up of the respective smart-contract, a trade-off between the level of multilateral agreement and practicability (i.e., upgradeability) can be ensured, while counterparty risk could be avoided.
When using off-chain assets (such as fiat currencies), a natural person or legal entity (in jargon “legal personhood”) must be assigned control over the respective assets. This legally identifiable point of contact has legal control over off-chain assets and thus introduces counterparty risk. It would be possible to abuse the legal authority over the DAO’s assets and disregard decisions of the DAO (i.e., do a good old exit scam)9.

Discussions
Rule-based discussions can be executed on-chain via pre-voting. The core idea is that a smart contract is used for implementations such as token curated registries or prediction markets. As these implementations are based on smart contracts, they all are binding, formalized, and transparent.
Alternatively, a rule-based discussion could also be executed off-chain by linking a smart contract event to a legal contract.
If the discussion is not rule-based, it must be discretionary. By definition, discretionary discussions must be based on an off-chain medium. These could either be legal contracts that are not initiated or otherwise directly linked to smart contracts of the DAO, or - more commonly - various fora or messenger services.

Legislation 
Interestingly, the connection between DAOs and the legislative environment is currently in flux. The very first “connection” was, in fact, an attempt to deny such connection and simply disregard the legal environment. The DAO, for example, wanted to exist independent of any legislation. However, such a strategy merely results in giving up control over how the DAO will is treated under the law.

Fundamentally, DAO’s must have a legal entity. A legal entity also allows DAOs to subsequently integrate legal and smart contracts. As of now, the following two strategies can be identified:
DAOs can form a legal entity that will enable them to opt-out of any legal jurisdiction. This will, however, have repercussions on the DAO’s ability to manage off-chain funds.

DAOs can attempt to fully integrate and leverage one of the recently created legal entity structures to obtain legal personhood.


Once a DAO is incorporated and has legal personhood, it may wish to integrate legal contracts (in jargon “wet law”) and smart contracts. Various attempts have been made to achieve this goal:
An initial starting point was the attempt to - instead of writing smart contract code - merely write a written text that would express a legal intent.


Alternatively, “code” could be a written text that merely describes a contractual arrangement. Instead, however, being legally binding these first efforts were rather initial attempts resembling quick hacks and not binding solutions.


A more mature approach is to transform natural language agreements into machine-readable contract objects.

While incorporating smart contracts into wet law is still in a rather rudimentary stage, it is, nonetheless, a more pragmatic approach that reflects opinions stated in contemporary legal theory10.

The governance layer is responsible for essential functions which control the operation of the DAO ecosystem like software platform updates, smart contract amendments and voting procedures. This is highly proprietary to Mpowa and based on a hybrid on/off-chain governance model combining the best aspects of legal constitutional systems and AI driven fuzzy decision making based on network heuristics.





## Carbon Offset

The practice of carbon offsetting has arisen in a world where far too little is being done to address climate change. At a global level, relatively few organizations have taken meaningful action to reduce GHG emissions. As a result, for companies committed to taking action, it has not been hard to find low-cost carbon offsets. The potential supply of GHG reductions is huge, because there are so many sources of GHG emissions that face no legal or economic incentives to reduce.

The 2015 Paris Agreement could change this. For the first time, nearly every country in the world has identified explicit actions (i.e., “contributions”) they agree to make to reduce GHG emissions and adapt to climate change. This approach is a major change from the Kyoto Protocol, where only industrialized countries committed to reducing emissions. Under Kyoto, offsetting was an explicit and prominent strategy: industrialized countries could fund offset projects in developing countries, providing them with needed investment, and promoting sustainable development. In exchange, industrialized countries could more cheaply meet their obligations, by claiming the reductions achieved by these projects. Developing countries benefited from such an exchange because they faced no obligations themselves and therefore gave nothing up in allowing emission reductions to be “transferred.”

The Paris Agreement complicates this older picture considerably. The fact that every country has agreed to reduce emissions means there will be fewer opportunities for additional reductions – i.e., reductions that go beyond what countries have pledged (and would otherwise not happen in the absence of a carbon offset market – see Additionality). This does not mean the end of carbon offsetting. In fact, Article 6 of the Paris Agreement explicitly recognizes the possibility for international cooperation through the transfer of emission reductions. However, if a country allows an emission reduction to be claimed by another party (either another country or some other entity), it should no longer be able to count the reduction towards its own GHG target. The Paris Agreement has language expressly prohibiting such “double counting” among countries.

Currently, it is envisioned that double counting will be avoided through “robust” accounting methods (the language used in Article 6). Specifically, if a country transfers an emission reduction, it will adjust its GHG balance sheets so that the reduction is not counted toward its pledged “contribution,” while a country receiving the transfer can apply the reduction to its own GHG balance sheet.[1] Similar accounting will likely be done for emission reductions funded by the international aviation industry, which has pledged to offset any increase in its GHG emissions after 2020.[2] In principle, the same methods could be applied to backstop claims for carbon offset credits purchased by private voluntary buyers.






A variety of terms are frequently used to define quality criteria for carbon offsets, including that associated GHG reductions must be “real,” “quantifiable,” and “verifiable.” Most of these terms have their origin in regulatory criteria established for air pollutant credits under the U.S. Clean Air Act (going back to 1977). However, these terms have distinct regulatory meanings under U.S. law that do not always translate meaningfully to carbon offsets. The term “real,” for example, has no commonly agreed definition across carbon offset programs and standards, and is often used as a vague catch-all.[2]

For this guide, therefore, we have distilled the essential elements of carbon offset quality down to five criteria. In short, quality carbon offset credits must be associated with GHG reductions or removals that are:

Additional
Not overestimated
Permanent
Not claimed by another entity
Not associated with significant social or environmental harms

## ESG Fund

Scalingfunds to attract investors and in order to create a clear investment profile and indication of RoI. 

ScalingFunds builds software that advances the real estate and private equity industry
ScalingFunds was officially established in January 2018 by Jakob Drzazga, a former real estate asset manager investing in impact projects around Germany. Out of the inefficiencies he experienced while launching his first real estate fund, he founded ScalingFunds.
Jakob’s vision was to enable emerging local fund managers to pursue their passion without having a massive barrier to entry through enormous setup costs, intransparent processes and dependency on never-ending expensive legal advice. Enabling local experts to invest in regional projects would benefit communities outside of hotspots and allow impact projects to take place where they are needed the most. 	In recent years, with the growing demand for digital workflows within the fund industry, ScalingFunds has won the trust of established fund managers with more than €7bn AUM and fund administrators with more than €500bn.

	We are strong believers that Alternative Investment Funds will overtake their public counterparts in volume in the next decade. To achieve that, we need more automation and ease of use for General Partners (GPs), Limited Partners (LP) and Transfer Agents (TAs).

## Impact-NFT Marketplace










## Geolocation

Mpowa’s region of focus will primarily be Africa, due to the severe poverty that humanity is dealing with there in comparison to the rest of the world.
 For apparent reasons, Mpowa prioritizes to allocate its support to rural areas of Africa. Micro-particles, Co2 levels, and other greenhouse-gas emissions are at dangerously high levels, causing direct and indirect harm to its citizens and the environment in which they reside.
Mpowa’s team is international with the company ‘’Mpowa Ltd’’ being founded in the United Kingdom. 





## Methodology

DATA COLLECTION METHODS FOR EACH GOAL !!!! 
Data Sources and Collection Method


In order to actually attach verifiable impact to Mpowa platform contributions, we work together with the United Nations program Sustainable Development Goals, in line with the goals set in Agenda 2030. 

To be considered valid by official statisticians from the UN, we have to ensure that our data is collected in a certain way, alongside certain data and contains the necessary requirements as listed in the SDG handbook for documenting each target/goal indicator. 

By ensuring that the data that we collect from running projects complies to the Data Structure Definition (DSD) standard from the UN, it is likely that the data can be successfully implemented in the UN’s report. 
SIDS Partnership

A service identifies its customers/users via accounts. Message streams, whether one-shot or long-lived streams, are logically arranged into Channels, which in turn are owned by a single account. An account holder identifies itself to the platform via the account credentials. An account holder may generate API tokens which may be passed to third parties (message exchange counterparts), should the platform operator or Channel owner require authentication for its APIs.

The Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) established a cap-and-trade system that imposes national caps on the greenhouse gas emissions of high-income countries that ratified the Protocol (called Annex B countries). Each participating country is assigned an emissions target and the corresponding number of allowances – called Assigned Amount Units (AAUs).

## The Technology 


Overview of the technology that is used, modified and written in order for the Mpowa platform to function as it is supposed to.   The Substrate client is the software that runs the blockchain node, it includes the following components: storage, runtime, p2p network, consensus, RPC, telemetry. 


### Runtime Architecture

The mpowa Runtime is built using FRAME and consists of pallets from substrate, frontier, cumulus, and `pallets/`.

From substrate:

- _Utility_: Allows users to use derivative accounts, and batch calls
- _Balances_: Tracks GLMR token balances
- _Sudo_: Allows a privileged account to make arbitrary runtime changes - will be removed before
  launch
- _Timestamp_: On-Chain notion of time
- _Transaction Payment_: Transaction payment (fee) management
- _Randomness Collective Flip_: A (mock) onchain randomness beacon. Will be replaced by parachain
  randomness by mainnet.

From frontier:

- _EVM_: Encapsulates execution logic for an Ethereum Virtual Machine
- _Ethereum_: Ethereum-style data encoding and access for the EVM.

From cumulus:

- _ParachainUpgrade_: A helper to perform runtime upgrades on parachains
- _ParachainInfo_: A place to store parachain-relevant constants like parachain id

The following pallets are stored in `pallets/`. They are designed for mpowa's specific requirements:

- _Ethereum Chain Id_: A place to store the chain id for each mpowa network
- _Author Inherent_: Allows block authors to include their identity in a block via an inherent
- _Parachain Staking_: Minimal staking pallet that selects collators by total amount at stake



### Blockchain tech

Plugging into a multi-chain framework. 

Mpowa is utilizing Party Technology’s Substrate Node pallet to create a blockchain that is fully customizable to what the company needs. 

Substrate can be described as a blockchain framework — specifically, a framework for building customized blockchains. These blockchains can be run entirely autonomously, which means they don't depend on any external technology to run

That means Polkadot can be used as a kind of bridge between blockchains, taking care of the communication layer between chains and making it possible to interact between different blockchains (even systems such as Ethereum and Bitcoin). This represents significant progress toward making the vision of Web3 — a decentralized, blockchain-based version of the internet — a reality.
Since they were developed by the same people, Substrate has first-class support for integrating with Polkadot, so any blockchain you create with Substrate can seamlessly be hooked into Polkadot.

An Ethereum compatible smart-contract Parachain on Polkadot. 



### Substrate Chain

Runtime

The runtime of a blockchain is the business logic that defines its behavior. In Substrate-based chains, the runtime is referred to as the "state transition function"; it is where Substrate developers define the storage items that are used to represent the blockchain's state as well as the functions that allow blockchain users to make changes to this state.

Each Substrate node contains a runtime. The runtime contains the business logic of the chain. It defines what transactions are valid and invalid and determines how the chain's state changes in response to transactions. The "outer node", everything other than the runtime, does not compile to Wasm, only to native. The outer node is responsible for handling peer discovery, transaction pooling, block and transaction gossiping, consensus, and answering RPC calls from the outside world. While performing these tasks, the outer node sometimes needs to query the runtime for information, or provide information to the runtime. A Runtime API facilitates this kind of communication between the outer node and the runtime.

Prospective partnership with acknowledged CTX Global Carbon Credit Exchange facilitate the platform-subscribers with a reward mechanism. The Carbon Offset that is generated through a specific Mpowa clean-tech project, will be listed in Carbon Credits on the CTX Global for purchase by SME’s and larger corporate organizations to reduce their Carbon Footprint. The profits that are generated by Mpowa for selling Carbon Credits will be forwarded to the reward-pool on the exchange where the Mpowa Security Token is listed. Rewards are allocated on to the stakeholders of a project as a reward for providing initial liquidity to enable the project to occur.
For the pilot project the profits of the Carbon offset sale are not redirected to

Each NFT is linked to a certificate of ownership, which carries certain rights and obligations in the DAO, and KYC information.  Another feature of our project-based NFT’s, is that they contain ownership-rights to tokenized representations of Carbon Offset Credits, which are minted upon data-retrieval.   For the pilot project we will launch a token-sale to spark the funding for platform and the project.   The project-based NFT’s will be listed on an NFT-Marketplace where costumers can purchase their share in a specific project. The assets available on the NFT-Marketplace can also be purchased through our platform App, which then will be stored in their Mpowa-Wallet. If one wishes to sell their NFT, they can do so by requesting a re-listing of their specific NFT on the NFT-Marketplace.

A smart contract is a dynamic contract that is managed by an autonomous agent (off-chain representative) using the Access Controls. The smart contract operates on behalf of the issuer for all administrative tasks associated with maintaining and updating the contract's on-chain records. The smart contract service is responsible for monitoring data that effect the state of the smart contract and for incorporating those changes into the contract. The smart contract can also work with other autonomous agents working on behalf of the issuer or other contracting parties to fully automate all the various processes and tasks associated with the formation and performance of a contract. 

Dynamic contracts typically undergo regular amendments to account for the transfer, change or exercise of ownership rights/duties of the contracting parties, as well as other associated administrative tasks. The use of software and distributed ledgers provides an opportunity to improve the administration, monitoring and performance of these types of contracts.

A smart contract is a dynamic contract that uses an autonomous agent to improve the utility of the contracting experience. The smart contract enforces the rules (T&C’s) of the contract and allows for tools to issue, exchange, govern and enforce ownership rights and duties with respect to the T&C’s and the laws the contract is subject to. The smart contract described in the Tokenized protocol uses the Bitcoin ledger to store all records relevant to the contract.

Tokens are used by smart contracts to manage the ownership rights (and duties) of a contract. The downside of smart contracts is the ongoing costs of operating the service, but these costs are much, much cheaper than alternative/traditional means.

We present a simpler way for people to understand and interact with blockchain. Some of the benefits of utilizing smart contracts on a blockchain are: 
Reducing or complete avoidance of intermediary and overall project, 
Maximized transparency of cost, time and scope of project, 
Limited complexity enabling informed decision making, 
Efficient resolution of contractual gray areas.

 
Smart contracts are aiming to revolutionize many industries by replacing the need for both traditional legal agreements and centrally automated digital agreements. Both performance verification and execution rely on manual actions from one of the contracting parties, or an automated system that programmatically retrieves and updates relevant changes. Unfortunately, because of their underlying consensus protocols, the blockchains on which smart contracts run cannot support native communication with external systems. In this paper we present Mpowa, a decentralize governance token. On Mpowa Platform we describe our components for providing governance token to gain effective, legitimate and transparent transaction.

An organization represented by rules encoded as a computer program that is transparent, controlled by the organization members and not influenced by a central government.
A DAO's financial transaction record and program rules are maintained on a blockchain.  The precise legal status of this type of business organization is unclear. 
The Mpowa Platform is a revolutionary new concept. A physical self powering blockchain ecosystem which monetizes free energy in the form of tokens, is self funded by its community and operates as a true exponential DAO.	
Our platform is the core of the magic. The  Mpowa Energy Units connect to the platform which manages the tokenization of the energy. After getting online, the unit becomes available for use. The user installs a simple app from the AppStore or PlayStore and creates an account. After registration, the user receives some tokens for first use. Using the app, the QR code on the unit is scanned, and the unit (or socket on the unit) is unlocked. After plugging in an appliance, the tokens get consumed as the user draws electricity rom the unit. If the tokens run out, the user can buy new tokens in the app using a credit card or other payment methods. The energy tokens are not tied to your name, and can be transferred between users.
A similar method is used for our pilot project where recipients of the Solvatten Unit have to login our their data-monitoring app where they manually declare their usage and receive tokens in accordance to the amount of water that has been purified with the device.









### Exemplary projects

The pilot project is designed to validate our solution through manual execution of all critical steps from project formulation to funding and implementation, with the combined power of donor organizations and the general public. We will partner with Solvatten for our initial pilot(s) and kickoff the platform using their water purification device. 


Clean-Tech partner for Project I - Solvatten 
“Solvatten is a combined portable water treatment and water heating system that has been designed for off-grid household use in the developing world. It is an easy, innovative solution that provides access to clean, hot water to people all over the world. Thanks to its durable design, Solvatten is an affordable and convenient way to get clean, hot water. 
In the developing world, millions of primarily women and children must walk dozens of miles each day to fetch water and firewood. Reducing the daily use of firewood for heating water and utilizing a solution that can be used on unimproved water sources closer to home makes life much easier for these people. Solvatten has an average lifespan of 7-10 years, essential during the first years of life when children are at their most susceptible to waterborne diseases. 
The lack of safe water leading to poor hygiene and poor health are daily challenges for millions of people living in poverty. Worldwide, 1 of 3 people live without reliable access to electricity and 1 out of 8 people live without access to safe, clean water at home. Due to the lack of a reliable energy infrastructure in the developing world, people use natural resources – such as wood and charcoal – for cooking, washing and heating water. Up to 70% of the energy used by a typical home in Sub-Saharan Africa is used for these purposes. This strong dependence on natural resources leads to numerous personal issues including smoke inhalation and burn injuries. It also increases carbon dioxide emissions and leads to deforestation, which gravely impact environmental issues. Indoor plumbing and secure electricity are distant dreams for far too many people.”

GHG emissions constitute a special category of air emissions. GHG emission inventories are compiled based on the guidelines developed by the IPCC, under the auspices of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The source categories of GHG emissions are based on processes. The categories of sinks for GHG emissions are also included. GHGs include both direct and indirect GHGs. The most important direct GHGs are carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), and the most important indirect GHGs are sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and non-methane volatile organic compounds (NM-VOCs).
3.169. While the IPCC guidelines prescribe process-based source categories, sources must be broken down by economic activity based on ISIC, to ensure consistency with and linkages to economic statistics. GHGs from international transport and tourism must be estimated to produce emission accounts. Air emissions generated by tourists may also be estimated to measure the environmental impacts of tourism.


The Business Alliance for Water and Climate (BAFWAC) was launched during COP 21 in December 2015. The Alliance was formed to elevate the issue of water within the climate discussions and focuses on advancing SDG6 and 13 though also touches upon other water-related SDGs such as those on sustainable agriculture, responsible consumption and production, and ecosystems.
The Alliance was launched by CDP, the CEO Water Mandate, Suez, and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development. It functions as a commitment platform, asking companies to commit to 3 areas:
1) Analyzing and sharing water related risks to implement collaborative response strategies
2) Measuring and reporting water use data
3) Reducing impacts on water in operations and throughout the value chain
Today, over 40 companies with $650 billion in annual revenues have made the commitment. In addition, the initiative looks to work with companies to build a community of good practice tools,
  19
resources, and eventually local activities around three innovation areas: circular water management, climate resilient agriculture, and natural infrastructure.

Soil pollution

Soil pollution is typically caused by chemicals and other residuals disposed of by humans. The most common sources of soil contamination include leakage from underground storage tanks and pipelines, the use of pesticides in agriculture and forestry, the percolation of polluted waters, oil and fuel dumping, direct discharges of wastewater and industrial residuals to the soil, and deposition from air pollution.

Some of the most commonly measured soil pollutants include petroleum hydrocarbons (e.g., oil residuals and solvents), pesticides and heavy metals.

Data for soil pollution are produced primarily by monitoring stations and are related to those specific locations. The data from these monitoring stations require further processing to produce environment statistics on the soil quality of specific locations. The resulting environment statistics should be produced and be relevant for the specific local areas where the most problematic soil pollution conditions exist. Owing to local variations in soil quality, it will be very difficult to develop figures that are representative at national level.

Soil pollution directly affects human and environmental health and land productivity based on factors including pollutant concentration, depth of contact with biota and density of humans in polluted areas. However, soil pollution is rarely monitored. It is usually documented and measured after major pollution events that require clean-up or intervention. Thus, the data available for statistical purposes are usually limited and not systematic.
Statistics on soil pollution also cover statistics on contaminated sites. The term “contaminated site” refers to a well-defined area where the presence of soil pollution has been confirmed, and this presents a potential risk to humans, water, ecosystems or other receptors. The term “potentially contaminated site” refers to sites where unacceptable soil contamination is suspected but not verified and detailed investigations need to be carried out to verify whether there is unacceptable risk of adverse impacts on receptors.39 Relevant statistics include the number and area of contaminated, potentially contaminated, remediated and other sites.

Crops refer to plants or agricultural produce grown for food or other economic purposes, such as clothes or livestock fodder (ISIC Rev. 4, Section A, Division 01). In its race to improve crop production, modern large-scale agriculture has increased the use of anthropogenic inputs in the form of labour, irrigation, chemical fertilizers, pesticides and new or modified genetic material. On the other hand, small-scale agriculture, which may be less resource intensive, may be more environmentally friendly.

In terms of environment statistics, both the area used for cultivated crops and yields are important. Furthermore, crop production methods, which can have different environ- mental consequences, are highly relevant. Monoculture, the practice of growing one type of crop intensively over an area, can benefit farmers because of its uniform growing requirements and standardized planting, maintenance and pest control. Overall, monoculture and resource-intensive farming have increased crop yield, greatly reducing the amount of land needed for crop production. However, in recent decades, the rise of monocultures has also led to widespread environmental sustainability concerns, including soil nutrient loss, widespread pest invasions and biodiversity loss. Organic production is growing in importance, benefiting both the environment and human health, but it still constitutes a small proportion of crops worldwide.

The application of biotechnology in the agriculture sector has led to the increased use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and products derived from them. GMOs are organ- isms produced through techniques in which the genetic material has been altered in a way that does not occur naturally by mating and/or natural recombination”.58 These organisms may include genetically modified seeds and grain, plant tubers, spores, plant t0issue and cells. Measuring their use is an important aspect of environment statistics because of their relevance in maintaining genetic variability, possible effect on non-target organisms and implication in the evolution of pest resistance and loss of biodiversity. Maintaining genetic variability is also interconnected with genetic resources, which should not be confused with GMOs. Genetic

Components of the FDES and the Basic Set of Environment Statistics


Resources are defined as the genetic material of plants, animals or microorganisms contain- ing functional units of heredity that are of actual or potential value as a resource for future generations of humanity.59 Although statistics on genetic resources are not collected, they are accounted for through the Nagoya Protocol, which ensures the conservation and sustainable use of genetic resources.

For environment statistics, this topic covers statistics about the area used for and the production of main crop types, annual and perennial crops, different planting methods, mono- culture and resource-intensive farming systems, the use of GMOs, and organic farming. Area harvested is especially important when measuring sown or planted areas (gross) versus har- vested areas (net).60 Fertilizers play a key role in the yield and quantity of crops produced, as well as in the environmental effects of agriculture. Therefore, the amount of natural fertilizers, such as manure or compost, and chemical fertilizers are also relevant. Because of their effect on biodiversity, invasive pests and pollution, statistics on the use of pesticides (e.g., fungicides, herbicides, insecticides and rodenticides) are also considered essential to environment statistics. With the significant growth of modern intensive farming practices and genetically modified crops, constructing these statistics can be particularly relevant to some countries. Finally, imports and exports of crops can also be an important measure of total production, apparent national consumption and, possibly, the associated pressure on the environment. The main institution providing data, besides the NSO, is usually the agricultural authority.




Livestock are animal species that are raised by humans for commercial purposes, consumption or labour (ISIC Rev. 4, Section A, Division 01). Usually raised in agricultural settings, typical livestock species include cows, poultry, pigs, goats and sheep. Rising incomes and grow- ing populations, especially in the developing world, have led to higher demands for livestock products, including milk, eggs and meat, thus driving growth in the livestock sector.61 Nonetheless, livestock rearing is associated with multiple environmental effects. Livestock production contributes to GHG emissions. Animal husbandry (grazing and production of feedstock) occupies a large percentage of land, directly or indirectly. Clearing land for pasture and feed crops has led to widespread deforestation and biodiversity loss and overgrazing leads to erosion and compaction. Furthermore, livestock production accounts for large amounts of water use and constitutes a source of water pollution from hormone use and other chemicals, as well as from the inadequate handling of manure.

A limited number of genetically modified animals, animal substances, tissues and micro-organisms have been introduced in the production of livestock and fish to date. The goal is to add economic value by introducing specific substances or tissue modifications. This could produce unintended environmental effects relating to the place of introduction or the nature of expression of GMOs.

Despite these prevalent environmental implications, however, livestock contributes to the livelihoods of millions of the world’s poor, providing an income source, and sometimes the only source, for many. Therefore, measuring livestock impacts and driving efficiency in the production line is vital.

Environmentally relevant statistics on livestock include the number and characteristics of live animals, as well as antibiotics and hormones used for them. Furthermore, imports and exports of livestock are also a good measure of national livestock quantity and, possibly, of pressure on the environment.

The main provider of data for livestock statistics is usually the agricultural authority or the NSO.

## Market Analysis and potential


Carbon market

Global Voluntary Carbon Offsets market size is projected to reach US$ 700.5 million by 2027, from US$ 305.8 million in 2020, at a CAGR of 11.7% during 2021-2027.”

MARKET OF CONTRIBUTIONS TO CHARITY LIKE PROJECTS 


SDG monitoring

The UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are increasingly at the heart of businesses’ sustainability strategies. Today, businesses cannot focus solely on the bottom line but must create value at all levels, including for wider society, with more companies engaging with the global goals.  

Sustainability can boost reputations
Environmental pressures, such as climate change, pollution and water scarcity, are sparking new levels of global concern, shifting consumers' values, preferences and behaviour. In response, businesses are starting to consider the idea of purpose beyond economic profit. As more companies design products with sustainability in mind, it will become vital to understand where the greatest needs and most significant investment opportunities lie.
Circular economy to fight resource scarcity
“Doing more with less” is the mantra of circular businesses that aim to make the most of the available resources, either extending products’ use or giving them a second life. There is an explosion of new business models based on sharing, reusing, renting and repairing, along with new end of life solutions (ie recycling, composting and repurposing).
Climate positive to turn the tide on climate change
Climate change is back in the spotlight, with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report calling for “urgent and unprecedented changes” to avoid catastrophic consequences. Businesses are joining global climate strikes for the first time, and investing in innovative climate positive products and technologies that help fight global warming.
Waterless products to navigate the water crisis
Most products require water to be produced and/or used. As water becomes increasingly scarce in some parts of the world, consumers and businesses are facing the consequences of water shortages. Companies are launching products that make more efficient use of this resource, from waterless formulations to products that require less water to be rinsed off.
Products to clean the air
With air quality deteriorating in urban areas, companies are developing new products that either help consumers to improve indoor air quality or protect them from pollution.

Several global surveys have showcased the increased attention companies are giving to public reporting in line with the SDG framework. In 2018, KPMG analysis showed that 40% of the world’s 250 largest companies discuss SDGs in their reporting,1 while a 2019 report by Oxfam, Walk the Talk, found 62% of companies in an analyzed sample have made a public commitment to the SDGs.2 Better yet, a 2019 survey by World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) and DNV GL found that among the 250 global companies surveyed, 82% have reported on the SDGs.3 A minority of companies report on all 17 SDGs; most prioritize a select few.

Several pension funds, linking the need for long-term performance with constituents’ values, have increased allocations to SDG investments, including the Danish SDG Investment Fund ($752 billion) and ABP ($68 billion by 2020); Australia’s Cbus Super Fund and CalPERS have announced plans to align investment strategies with the SDGs.
Starting in 2017, the World Bank issued bonds (US$23.5 billion) managed by BNP Paribas that directly link to the performance of companies advancing SDG priorities. HSBC made headways in late 2018 when it issued its first SDG bond for $1 billion, allocating proceeds towards green building, social housing, renewable energy and other sustainability categories. In the first half of 2019, $10.3 billion in SDG bonds and $5.5 billion in social bonds were issued, with 50% of volumes comprising financial and non-financial corporates.7
On September 26th, 25-30 CEOs of large companies around the world will launch the Global Investors for Sustainable Development Alliance (GISD) at the UN General Assembly with the intention of implementing an investment plan for sustainable development.8
Renewable Energy and Buildings Projects Receive the Most Attention
While SDG-related financing is diverse, green building and renewable energy projects lead the bulk of investment among financing by the private sector. Two of the largest allocations of the HSBC SDG Bond are for green building (38%) and renewable energy (18%), while the Danish SDG Investment Fund intends to invest in a number of sectors, including sustainable energy and infrastructure. Green bonds, majorly allocated towards renewable energy and green construction, are steadily increasing with over $100 billion issued in the first half of 2019. 9
Analysis: SDG Impact of the S&P 500
Measuring SDG implementation is specific to geography and also to industry, as different countries are at varying stages of SDG attainment, and industries vary in how their activities affect their area of operation. In addition to the industry a business operates in, there is also the geographic distribution of its value chain – where it sources its materials and sells its products – that will have its own impact on a broad range of issues related to the SDGs.
Modeling can assist in filling gaps when there is lack of data or detailed information on the range of SDG issues that may occur within a business’s value chain. Accordingly, Trucost developed an inputoutput model approach to evaluate the baseline exposure of a company to each SDG. Trucost’s SDGExtended Multiregional Input-Output Model (SDGI-O) models economic flows and associated exposure to SDG-related risks across countries and sectors globally. Trucost considers SDG risk as the risk that a company may be directly or indirectly causing a negative impact on the SDGs (such as greenhouse gas emissions in the supply chain) or the risk that a company may be dependent on practices and activities that conflict with the SDGs (such as underpayment of wages or child labor). The SDGI-O model contains 45 metrics based off the 169 SDG targets that are then aggregated on the Goal level. These metrics were selected due to their direct application to the private sector and adequate data availability.
The SDGs were launched as a blueprint for a more just, sustainable and prosperous future. The private sector has begun to understand its role in contributing to their attainment, as seen by increasing rates in corporate disclosure on the SDGs. Investors are also increasingly interested in benchmarking the performance of companies on the SDGs, and different mechanisms to compare and rank companies are emerging in the form of indexes, benchmarks and, in the case of the World Benchmarking Alliance, league tables.

Pursuing data-driven analysis for understanding the full impact of a business across its value chain can be useful in understanding where to minimize risks and maximize both SDG and financial returns. Leveraging the SDGs as not only a framework for sustainable development but also for innovation towards generating new, more future-ready revenue streams can help identify business opportunities that simultaneously serve the needs of the SDGs.

## Token Launches

Launches & pre-sales before listing on centralized and decentralized exchanges.

Utility Token - Q2, Native + Exchanges.

NFT - Polkastarter Q2, Distributed + native.

Security Token - Q2, To be discussed. 

In the United Kingdom security tokens are managed the same way as other types of securities with corresponding substantive characteristics, which makes the UK’s regulatory regime technology-neutral.
The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) covers the territory of the UK and is responsible for developing relevant STO frameworks that help regulate the issuance of security tokens.
The FCA differentiates between three types of tokens: exchange, utility, and security.
In the UK, security tokens are qualified as special investments and fall under the Regulated Activities Order and within the regulatory area of the FCA. In its Guidance on Cryptoassets, the FCA defines security tokens as cryptoassets that grant holders rights and obligations similar to traditional financial instruments.
The Financial Conduct Authority has maintained a supportive stance towards blockchain and all its related concepts. In August 2020, it even approved the first security token exchange, making the UK one of the first authorized trading spaces for assets in the world.

Equity Tokens
An equity token is similar to traditional stock, except for how ownership is recorded and transferred. Traditionally, the tracking of shares is logged in a database, with ownership of shares printed and certified on paper certificates. Instead, an equity token is recorded on an immutable ledger kept up-to-date by tens, hundreds, or sometimes even thousands of computers networked worldwide. Equity token holders are entitled to a portion of the firm's profit and have a right to vote. Equity tokens offer three main benefits to a company's decision making, financial outlook, and regulatory frameworks:

Investors can participate in voting while abiding by securities laws.
Startups have access to new and, potentially, more democratized fundraising models.
Regulators have a new and more transparent framework for evaluating the fundraising of a project.



Security Token Offerings (STOs) combine the technology of blockchain with the requirements of regulated securities markets to support liquidity of assets and
wider availability of finance. STOs are typically the issuance of digital tokens in a blockchain environment in the form of regulated securities. The blockchain
environment enhances securities regulatory objectives of disclosure, fairness and market integrity and supports innovation and efficiency through automation and
“smart contracts”. In terms of the token aspect, an STO is essentially the digital representations of ownership of assets (e.g. gold, real estate) or economic rights (e.g. a share of profits or revenue). The goal of this publication is to serve as a guide to promoting deeper discussion and fostering the active participation of all stakeholders in the future evolution of the industry.






















## SWOT Matrix

The name is an acronym for the four components the technique examines:
Strengths: characteristics of the business or project that give it an advantage over others
Weaknesses: characteristics that place the business or project at a disadvantage relative to others
Opportunities: elements in the environment that the business or project could exploit to its advantage
Threats: elements in the environment that could cause trouble for the business or project

WOT analysis (or SWOT matrix) is a strategic planning and strategic management technique used to help a person or organization identify strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats related to business competition or project planning. It is sometimes called situational assessment or situational analysis.[1] Additional acronyms using the same components include TOWS and WOTS-UP.[2][3]
This technique is designed for use in the preliminary stages of decision-making processes and can be used as a tool for evaluation of the strategic position of organizations of many kinds (for-profit enterprises, local and national governments, NGOs, etc.).[4] It is intended to identify the internal and external factors that are favorable and unfavorable to achieving the objectives of the venture or project. Users of a SWOT analysis often ask and answer questions to generate meaningful information for each category to make the tool useful and identify their competitive advantage. SWOT has been described as a tried-and-true tool of strategic analysis,[5] but has also been criticized for its limitations, and alternatives have been developed.


Corporate planning includes steps such as:[18]
Setting objectives—defining what the organization is going to do
Environmental scanning
Internal appraisals of the organization—an assessment of the present situation as well as a portfolio of products/services and an analysis of the product/service lifecycle
Analysis of existing strategies—this should determine relevance from the results of an internal/external appraisal, and may include gap analysis of environmental factors
Defining strategic issues—key factors in the development of a corporate plan that the organization must address
Developing new/revised strategies—revised analysis of strategic issues may mean the objectives need to change
Establishing critical success factors—the achievement of objectives and strategy implementation
Preparation of operational, resource, and projects plans for strategy implementation
Monitoring all results—mapping against plans, taking corrective action, which may mean amending objectives/strategies

The Token Sale 
Purchaser Details 
SUMMARY OF TERMS 
The Company is offering Mpowa Tokens, as defined above, through a limited offering of the Tokens (the “Token Sale”), which purchasers (each, a “Purchaser”) may receive under the conditions described below, pursuant to the Purchase Agreement and the other Distribution Materials. The Token Sale requires the Company to deliver Mpowa Tokens to the Purchaser on substantially similar terms as described below, in exchange for a payment of funds by the Purchaser (the “Purchase Amount”) as of the execution date of the Purchase Agreement. 
Name: Title: Email: Address:
 Token Purchase Price: $X Number of Tokens Purchased: Total Purchase Amount in USD: Sale Option: Option 1 
Lockup: See Section “Token Lockup” p.6 
As discussed in more detail below, the Company has developed a crypto asset, Mpowa Tokens, for use in connection with the Company’s Blockchain, which facilitates the tokenization of numerous corporate finance documents. Subject to the restrictions described in the Purchase Agreement and this Token Term Sheet, executing the Purchase Agreement provides Purchasers with the Mpowa Tokens and, subsequently, to utilize the Company’s Blockchain. 
Purchasers may be institutions, corporations, family offices, venture capital funds of funds and private individuals (or their estate planning vehicles) that have “Non-U.S. Person” Status under Regulation S under the Securities Act) (a “United States Person”) and do not reside in Canada or China or any of the unsupported jurisdictions as stated on the Mpowa site. Purchasers will be required to (i) provide information verifying their status, (ii) complete the Company’s KYC/AML process and automated background check available at Mpowa.io and (iii) be approved by the Company as a Purchaser before purchasing any Tokens through a Purchase Agreement. 
Summary of the Purchase Opportunity 
Purchaser Qualifications

DISCLAIMER TO PURCHASERS 
● This Token Sale is extremely risky and is not an appropriate purchase for many potential Purchasers. 
● The Company has not determined, and will not determine, that participation in the Token Sale is suitable for any particular Purchaser. The Company is not recommending participating in this Token Sale to any potential Purchaser. You should seek out independent accounting, financial, legal, and tax advice before participating. 
● You should not participate in the Token Sale unless you are able to bear a total and complete loss of your purchase. ● Your purchase also may be highly illiquid, so you should not 
purchase Tokens in this Token Sale if you may need to liquidate the purchased Tokens at a particular time. The Company cannot predict when, or even if, a Purchaser will have any liquidity in the purchase. 
● The Company anticipates the Blockchain evolving over time in connection with further development efforts by third-party developers and community modifications. Purchasers who are considering executing a Purchase Agreement should not rely on the terms for the Tokens or the Blockchain described in this Token Term Sheet as being a promise or guarantee that the Tokens and Blockchain will remain as described herein. 
The Mpowa Tokens can be used on the Mpowa Chain and the Ethereum Blockchain, to enable Token holders to participate in activities possible on Mpowa Chain and Ethereum. The Tokens do not confer any ownership or equity rights in the Company, or any profit or revenue sharing rights in the Company’s operations, or the right to vote on how the Company is operated. 
The issue price per Token will be $X per Token (the “Token Price”). There is no guarantee that the Token Price will reflect the anticipated value on a free market basis which will be determined by a wide range of factors, which are outside the Company’s control. The Token Price may be significantly above or below the anticipated value. 
The templates of the Distribution Materials shall be available to Purchasers at Mpowa.io. Before being approved to purchase Tokens in the Token Sale, Purchasers will be required to (i) provide information verifying their status as Non-US Persons and (ii) complete the Company’s KYC/AML process available at Coinlist.co. Once the Company approves the status of the Purchaser, and the Purchaser has indicated to the Company the amount of the Purchaser’s Purchase Amount, the Company will customize the Distribution Materials for the individual Purchaser, which will include the name and wire transfer information to the Company’s bank. The Purchaser will provide the Purchase Amount in U.S. Dollars. 
A Purchaser can receive Mpowa Tokens via their Mpowa.io account. The Purchaser should consult with independent tax advisors as to the consequences of receiving the Mpowa Tokens. 
It is anticipated that the value of the Tokens will fluctuate over time. After delivery, the value of the Tokens may be determined based on current pricing on third-party exchanges, and in the absence of such pricing, the price of the Tokens may be limited to what a buyer is willing to pay in a privately negotiated arms-length transaction. The Company is not under any obligation to provide Token valuations to Purchasers and provides no guarantees that it will take affirmative steps to facilitate a secondary market for the Tokens. There can be no guarantee that the Tokens will hold their value or increase in value. Many factors will influence this outcome, including increased activity on the Blockchain, demand for the Blockchain’s services as blockchain projects proliferate, and other factors that are outside of the Company’s control. 
The Purchase Agreement will expire and terminate upon the issuance of Mpowa Tokens to the Purchaser. 
Execution of the Purchase Agreement gives each Purchaser the right to receive a certain number of Mpowa Tokens. If it is determined that the Tokens constitute securities under U.S. law, the Tokens would be subject to additional restrictions on transfer and would not be transferable in the United States or to U.S. persons absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements. Any transfer made in violation of these provisions will be void. 
If the Tokens are found to constitute securities under U.S. law, then under the Securities Act and Rule 144 promulgated thereunder, the Tokens should become freely tradable after one year, as long as the initial issuance and subsequent transfers of the Tokens are subject to an available exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and neither the Company nor an affiliate has held the Tokens during the one-year holding period. 
Until XX XX XX, the Purchaser shall not sell, make any short sale or loan, grant any option for the purchase of, or otherwise dispose of Tokens. 

The Tokens will not give holders the rights to any of the profits or revenue of the Company, any merchant, or other participant using the Blockchain. The Tokens will not entitle holders to dividends or distributions made by the Company. Holders of the Tokens also will not have any right to vote on any aspect of how the Company is governed and shall not receive voting rights in the Company. Although holders of Tokens will be entitled to participate in the governance mechanisms of the Blockchain itself, such rights should not be construed as the right to govern the Company as a separate entity in any manner. 
Purchasers will not be charged any fees by the Company in connection with executing a Purchase Agreement or receiving Mpowa Tokens based on the Purchase Agreement. Purchasers may be charged fees by XXX. 
Any returns that a Purchaser receives based on appreciation of the Tokens, or as a result of transactions on the Blockchain, could be taxable. Prospective Purchasers should discuss the potential tax consequences of participating in this Token Sale with their tax advisors. 
The Purchase Agreement will require that Purchasers agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its officers, directors, principals, members, employees, agents, and other affiliates, and each other person, if any, who controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with any of them (each, an “Indemnified Party”), from and against any and all loss, claim, damage, liability or expense whatsoever (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and disbursements) due to or arising out of or based upon (i) any inaccurate representation or warranty made by the Purchaser, or breach or failure by the Purchaser to comply with any covenant or agreement made by the Purchaser in the Purchase Agreement or in any other document furnished by the Purchaser in connection with a purchase of the Tokens, (ii) any action for securities, commodities, or money transmission law violations instituted by the Purchaser that is finally resolved by judgment against the Purchaser, or (iii) any action instituted by or on behalf of the Purchaser against an Indemnified Party that is finally resolved by judgment against the Purchaser or in favor of an Indemnified Party. The liabilities associated with these indemnification provisions may be material to Purchasers, and Purchasers may incur significant costs as a result of their indemnification obligations. 

There is no guarantee that the Company will be successful at deploying additional Tokens as described herein. Further, a government could even prohibit the commercial or non-commercial use of the cryptographic methods necessary to the release of the additional Tokens and operation of the Blockchain. Regulators in key jurisdictions could fail to share the Company’s assessment of the Tokens not constituting securities or could find that the Tokens should be subject to other regulatory frameworks, which could create additional liability and potentially impose transfer restrictions that make the Blockchain’s operation, as currently contemplated, difficult or impossible. Any of these negative outcomes could lead to the Company forgoing its plan to conduct additional Token Generation, and/or otherwise release more Tokens, or such actions may require the Company to restructure the Tokens and the Blockchain in ways not contemplated herein. As a result, the Company may be unable to deliver Tokens pursuant to the Purchase Agreement or reimburse the Purchase Amount received under a Purchase Agreement. 
There can be no assurance that any Purchaser will achieve his or her objective in purchasing the Tokens or avoid substantial losses by purchasing Tokens through this Token Sale. Instruments like the Tokens entail a high degree of risk, and Purchasers may lose some or all of their Purchase Amount. A potential Purchaser should execute a Purchase Agreement and purchase Tokens only if able to withstand a total loss of the Purchase Amount. 
Crypto assets such as the Tokens are a new and relatively untested product. There is considerable uncertainty about the asset class’s long-term viability, which could be affected by a variety of factors, including many market-based factors such as economic growth, inflation, and others. In addition, the success of the Tokens and other types of crypto assets will depend on whether blockchain and other new technologies related to the Tokens turn out to be useful and economically viable. The Company does not control any of these factors, and therefore may not be able to control the long-term success of the Tokens as a feature of the Blockchain, or the ability of the Tokens to maintain their value. 
The Company cannot guarantee that holders of the Tokens will not be exposed to potential liability or claims as a result of the activities of other users on the Blockchain. While the Company does not currently anticipate users of the Blockchain incurring liability for illicit activity of other participants on the Blockchain, the Company cannot guarantee that regulators will share this assessment, and users may therefore not enjoy the same benefits afforded to traditional Internet companies. 

Transactions in crypto assets such as the Tokens and certain other virtual currencies are irreversible. Failure to provide the Company with the correct public wallet address under the control of the Purchaser will, in most cases, result in the loss of the Tokens. 
Once the Tokens are distributed, your Token balance is associated with your public key address, which is in turn associated with your private key address. You are responsible for knowing your private key address and keeping it a secret. Because a private key, or a combination of private keys, is necessary to control and dispose of the Tokens stored in your digital wallet or vault, the loss of one or more of your private keys associated with your digital wallet or vault storing the Tokens may result in the loss of your Tokens. Moreover, any third party that gains access to one or more of your private keys, including by gaining access to login credentials of a hosted wallet service you use, may be able to misappropriate your Tokens. The Company and its affiliates will never ask you for your private key address and you should never share them with someone you do not know.The terms described in this Token Term Sheet are subject to change, possibly substantially. The Company cannot guarantee that the Tokens will have the same characteristics as described herein.

The Purchaser understands that, upon acceptance by the Company, the Purchaser is not entitled to cancel, terminate or revoke this Purchase Agreement. 
2.3. International Regulatory Matters. 
(a) BVI Matters. The Purchaser acknowledges and understands that the Company is not registered with or licensed by any financial regulatory authority in the BVI Islands or elsewhere. Accordingly, no BVI Islands or other financial regulatory authority has passed upon the contents of this Agreement or the merits of purchasing Tokens, nor has this Agreement been filed with, or reviewed by any BVI Islands or other financial regulatory authority. The Purchaser further acknowledges and understands that the Tokens are not registered with any financial regulatory authority. 
(b) FDIC and SIPC Matters. The Tokens are not legal tender, are not backed by any government or otherwise, and accounts and value balances are not subject to Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or Securities Investor Protection Corporation protections. 
(c) Other Federal and State Regulatory Matters. The Purchaser acknowledges and understands that the Tokens are not registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and that the Company is not registered or licensed with any federal or state regulator as an 
      
investment adviser, broker-dealer, money services business (an “MSB”), money transmitter (an “MT”), or virtual currency business. As a result, the Purchaser will not be afforded the full set of protections provided to the clients and customers of such entities under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the Advisers Act, and any similar or applicable state laws. 
(d) No Registration of the Tokens. The Purchaser acknowledges and understands that (i) the Tokens have not been registered under the Securities Act, the securities laws of any state or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction, nor is that registration contemplated, (ii) the offering of the Tokens is being made only in those jurisdictions and to those persons where and to whom they may lawfully be offered for sale, and is not, and under no circumstances is to be construed as, a prospectus, an advertisement or a public offering of the Tokens in the United States, (iii) no securities regulatory authority has expressed an opinion about the status of the Tokens and it is an offence to claim otherwise, and (iv) the transactions contemplated in the Distribution Materials have not been reviewed by, passed on or submitted to any federal or state agency or self-regulatory organization. The Purchaser will not be afforded the full set of protections provided under the U.S. Securities Act or comparable state law or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction. If the Tokens are deemed to be securities, the Tokens would be subject to significant additional regulation, including restrictions on transferability and resale. This could lead to significant changes with respect to the Blockchain, how the Tokens are structured, how they are purchased and sold, and other issues, and would greatly increase the Company’s costs in creating and facilitating transactions in the Tokens. It could lead to the termination of the Tokens. Further, a regulator could take action against the Company and Sponsoring Parties if it views the Tokens as an unregistered offering of securities or otherwise as a violation of existing law. Any of these outcomes would negatively affect the value and functionality of the Tokens and/or could cause the Company to cease operations. 
(e) Registration Exemption of the Tokens.

(g) Money Transmission and Money Services Business Matters. The Sponsoring Parties believe that the Company is not an MT or an MSB. If the Company was deemed to be an MT and/or MSB, it would be subject to significant additional regulation. This could lead to significant changes with respect to the Blockchain, how the Tokens are structured, how they are purchased and sold, and other issues, and would greatly increase the Company’s costs in creating and facilitating transactions in the Tokens. It could lead to the termination of the Tokens. Further, a regulator could take action against the Company and Sponsoring Parties if it views the Tokens and the Blockchain as a violation of existing law. Any of these outcomes would negatively affect the value of the Tokens and/or could cause the Company to cease operations. 
(h) Virtual Currency/Asset Business Matters. 
(i) If the Company and the Sponsoring Parties were deemed to be conducting an unlicensed virtual currency or virtual asset business they would be subject to significant 
additional regulation and/or regulatory consequences. This could lead to significant changes with respect to the Blockchain, how the Tokens are structured, how they are purchased and sold, and other issues, and would greatly increase the Company’s costs in creating and facilitating transactions in the Tokens. It could lead to the termination of the Tokens. Further, a regulator could take action against the Company and the Sponsoring Parties if it views the Tokens and the Blockchain as a violation of existing law. Any of these outcomes would negatively affect the value of the Tokens and/or could cause the Company to cease operations. Purchasers are strongly encouraged to seek independent legal advice regarding their individual circumstances in determining whether they are eligible to purchase the Tokens.

The purchase of Tokens (i) does not provide Purchaser with rights of any form with respect to the Company or its revenues or assets, including, but not limited to, any voting, distribution, redemption, liquidation, proprietary (including all forms of intellectual property), or other financial or legal rights; (ii) is not a loan to Company; and (iii) does not provide Purchaser with any ownership or other interest in Company. 
(f) Intellectual Property. Company retains all current and future right, title and interest in all of Company’s intellectual property, including, without limitation, inventions, ideas, concepts, code, discoveries, processes, marks, methods, software, compositions, formulae, techniques, information and data, whether or not patentable, copyrightable or protectable in trademark, and any trademarks, copyright or patents based thereon. Purchaser may not use any of Company’s intellectual property for any reason without Company’s prior written consent unless otherwise noted in the software license, including but not limited to, licenses available to open source software. 
2.7. Purchaser’s Knowledge. The Purchaser has sufficient knowledge, understanding, and experience, either independently or together with his, her or its representative(s), in financial and business matters, and of the functionality, usage, storage, transmission mechanisms, and other material characteristics of cryptographic tokens, token wallets and other tokens storage mechanisms, public and private key management, blockchain technology, and blockchain-based software systems, to understand the terms of this Purchase Agreement and the Distribution Materials, and such knowledge, understanding, and experience enables the Purchaser to evaluate the merits and risks of purchasing the Tokens. 
2.8. Other Risks. 
(a) General Economic Risk. The Purchaser (i) is able to bear the economic cost of holding the Tokens for an indefinite period of time; (ii) has adequate means of providing for his, her, or its current needs and possible personal contingencies even in the event that the Tokens lose all of their value; and (iii) has no need for liquidity of the Tokens. The Purchaser’s purchase of the Tokens is consistent with the objectives and cash flow requirements of the Purchaser and will not adversely affect the Purchaser’s overall need for diversification and liquidity. 
(b) Additional Risk Disclosures. The Purchaser is solely responsible for reviewing, understanding and considering the risks above and any additional risks, including without limitation those described in the Distribution Materials. The Company and the Company’s operations, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by any one or more of those risk factors, as could the underlying value of each Purchaser’s Tokens, which may lead to the Tokens losing all value. 
(c) Self-Custody Risk. Once the Tokens are distributed, your Token balance is associated with your public key address, which is in turn associated with your private key address. You 
  
are responsible for knowing your private key address and keeping it a secret. Because a private key, or a combination of private keys, is necessary to control and dispose of the Tokens stored in your digital wallet or vault, the loss of one or more of your private keys associated with your digital wallet or vault storing the Tokens may result in the loss of your Tokens. Moreover, any third party that gains access to one or more of your private keys, including by gaining access to login credentials of a hosted wallet service you use, may be able to misappropriate your Tokens. The Company and its affiliates will never ask you for your private key address and you should never share them with someone you do not know. 
2.9. Transfer and Storage of Personal Data. 
(a) Personal Data. The Purchaser understands and agrees that in connection with the utilization of the Blockchain, Purchaser’s personal data may be transferred and/or stored in various jurisdictions in which the Sponsoring Parties have a presence, including in or to jurisdictions that may not offer a level of personal data protection equivalent to the Purchaser’s country of residence. 
(b) Disclosure of Personal Data. The Purchaser further understands and agrees that, although the Sponsoring Parties will use their reasonable efforts to keep the information provided in the answers to this Purchase Agreement strictly confidential, the Sponsoring Parties may present this Purchase Agreement and the information provided in it to any parties (e.g., affiliates, attorneys, auditors, administrators, brokers and regulators) as the Sponsoring Parties deem necessary or advisable to facilitate the acceptance and management of the Purchaser’s Tokens purchase, including, but not limited to, (x) in connection with anti-money laundering and similar laws, (y) if called upon to establish the availability under any applicable law of an exemption from registration of the Tokens or to establish compliance with applicable law generally by the Sponsoring Parties, or (z) if the information is relevant to any issue in any action, suit, or proceeding to which the Sponsoring Parties are a party or by which they are or may be bound. 
(c) Disclosure by Law. The Sponsoring Parties may also release information about the Purchaser if directed to do so by the Purchaser, if compelled to do so by law or in connection with any government or self-regulatory organization request or investigation. Any disclosure, use, storage or transfer of information for these purposes shall not be treated as a breach of any restriction upon the disclosure, use, storage or transfer of information imposed on any person by law or otherwise.
