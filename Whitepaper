Mpowa Ltd Whitepaper | Version 1.0

Preface

This blockchain-based interactive SaaS platform, is contrived to stimulate society to collectively ensure global resource sufficiency and accessibility for sustainable healthy living. Aiming to serve humanity as a whole, 
on the increasingly more turbulent and polluted planet earth. Averting unnecessary illness and death is the most important reason for Mpowa’s existence,
as every human being should ideally be able to live in a healthy way. By continually increasing the Energy Flux Density, resource abundance is within reach. 
Mpowa does not agree to the general consensus of mandatory vaccination and consumption control in order to reduce emissions.  

By also empowering externally organized SDG-oriented clean-tech projects to present themselves on the platform, Mpowa facilitates the industry with a high-standard GTM opportunity, 
while also permitting low-cap / high-value projects to raise the necessary funding to succeed.
Transparency and auditability are key features of blockchain technology, which provide traceability of funds (resource allocation can be tracked from start to finish) and verifiable Proof of Impact.
Constant transparency and credibility also differentiates the SaaS platform from established competitors and well known large-scale foundations that utilize traditional banking technology. 
Mpowa’s data-driven approach is in line with UN’s DSDs to match the United Nations National Quality Assurance Frameworks Manual for Official Statistics. By utilizing blockchain technology, 
Mpowa provides an additional credibility layer to ensure data quality, transparency of set definitions and important terms and project methodology towards contributors and auditors.

Introduction

This introduction will entail Mpowa’s core purpose, its SaaS-platform functionality with the appurtenant financial flow, 
alongside complementary information such as strategic goals, partnerships (consortium) and research data.
Written to inform the readers about the company and the complementary DAO, 
in order to increase the readers’ knowledge and create a valuable risk-assessment. 
MPOWA Ltd is exclusively a technology company, with all financial activity provided by third parties. 
MPOWA Ltd is not controlled or owned by any other organization which provides financial services. 
	The future of (cash) money will predominantly be digital, hence Mpowa’s choice of utilizing blockchain technology. 
Global adoption of blockchain technology to gain financial sovereignty through tokens, 
tokenized assets and DeFi applications is increasing at a fast pace. Also notable are the upcoming central bank digital currencies (CDBC), after many years of resistance. 
	As the regulatory and technological maturity levels stabilize globally in preparation for the mass adoption of these new digital technologies, Mpowa is planning to develop and launch a suite of digital tokens covering three major use cases: investment, data and payments. Each token is designed to address specific aspects of the NetZero transition to a sustainable circular economy, with the investment and data tokens working in tandem to provide end-to-end traceability of ESG investment flows from external funds through to the underlying economy as measured physically via IoT sensors and consecutively reported through defined SDG parameters. 
	Additionally, Mpowa’s goal is to launch an ISO20022 compliant zero carbon payment token for energy generation and consumption in Q3 of 2022, minted and mined on a global and distributed trustless network of interconnected Zero-Emission crypto-mining devices. This is realized through partnerships with Energy Web Foundation Crypto Climate Accord and Steroid 4.0 blockchain, amongst others.    

Transparency and auditability are key features of blockchain technology, which provide traceability of funds (resource allocation) and verifiable Proof of Impact. Through monitoring and verifying project-data on the blockchain, Mpowa initiates a global quality standard for the issuance of (Tokenized) Carbon Offset Credits, preventing double-selling and realizing real-time / direct offset. Customers won’t be purchasing project-approximation credits, but merely verified and realized tokenized Carbon Offset Credits. By creating the platform, Mpowa facilitates the clean-tech industry with a high-standard GTM opportunity, while also permitting low-cap / high-value projects to raise the necessary funding to succeed.
	
Through acquisition and spending of Mpowa’s Utility Token the users’ contributions will be submitted to project-fund pools, from which the designated parties will receive their share according to the product or service that is or will be delivered, in order to start or complete a project. Depending on the amount that is being contributed or the type of contribution, the user may receive an additional SDG Impact Token or a Non-Fungible Token (a certificate linking to the products that they’ve purchased for a beneficiary family). For certain projects, Tokenized Carbon Offset Credits will be distributed once the offset is realized. Data Tokens and Data-Logging Tokens are interlinked to specific NFT’s that facilitate the offset. These various ways of contributing to listed projects, are more thoroughly described in the sections ‘’The Platform’’ and ‘’Tokenomics’’. 
	Project-fund pools are better formulated as smart-contracts, which are financial software-programs that are continuously running on the blockchain, once deployed. This will be further elucidated in the chapter ‘’The Technology’’. 	All contributions will be acquired from verified platform-users, which have successfully submitted their necessary information through the implemented KYC-protocol, in order to ensure an entirely legitimate stack of contributions to ensure regulatory compliance. Mpowa has a strict and correct privacy policy to ensure safety of their users’ data. Not all data will be stored on the blockchain, yet shall be encrypted to prevent data-theft. 	Most contributions, with presumably different financial values, will have unique and fair voting properties carried with it, concerning projects and questions that are presented by the Mpowa-DAO. After purchase, these voting rights will become available for the contributor, through Governance Tokens. These project specific voting rights will be different for every project and every donation, carrying different properties that will be clearly described in the receipt before the users confirm their project-contribution. Read more about these voting properties in the chapter “DAO’’. Please note that the voting rights / Governance Tokens that may be granted to the contributor from acquiring a token or tokens only applies to matters/projects concerning the DAO and are not equal to possessing equity or shareholder-rights in the company, Mpowa Ltd, itself.
For a detailed disclaimer on token purchases, please read the chapter ‘’Disclaimer’’ and consult the additional documents available on the Mpowa website, or the documents provided by the approved exchanges that have listed Mpowa’s tokens. 	There are various methods to acquire the tokens that are issued by Mpowa, all which are described in the chapter ‘’Tokenomics’’. Every contributor should consult with independent tax advisors as to the consequences of receiving the Mpowa Token(s).  	It is anticipated that the value of the token(s) will fluctuate over time, except the Mpowa Utility Token (stablecoin) - which is 1:1 pegged with the Euro fiat currency. After delivery, the value of the tokens may be determined based on current pricing on third-party exchanges, and in the absence of such pricing, the price of the tokens may be limited to what a buyer is willing to pay in a privately negotiated arms-length transaction. The company is not under any obligation to provide token valuations to purchasers and provides no guarantees that it will take affirmative steps to facilitate a secondary market for the tokens. There can be no guarantee that the tokens will hold their value or increase in value. Many factors will influence this outcome, including increased activity on the blockchain, demand for the blockchain’s services as blockchain projects proliferate, and other factors that are outside of the company’s control.  The first token we are launching is the Mpowa Utility Token (stablecoin for project contributions), followed by a security token, the Mpowa SDG Impact Token - linked to the Mpowa Carbon Fund. This is an investment grade digital financial asset that is fully regulatory compliant and linked to our Luxembourg domiciled AIFM ESG fund launched in partnership with Scaling Funds. The Mpowa Utility Tokens are used in the Decarbonizer.app and the Decarbonizer Pro services to fund projects via the platform and provide complete traceability of funds from investors to impact via the blockchain. Depending on the project and contribution size, a certain amount of Mpowa SDG Impact Tokens will be transferred to the contributor. 	All Mpowa Tokens can used by enterprises, NGOs, charities and consumers to support ESG-related energy and water projects in line with 17 SDGs. The SDG Impact Tokens and Tokenized Carbon Credits are minted dynamically, according to the projects capacity.
The cryptocurrencies created by Mpowa are among the first (crypto)currencies to be born as carbon negative, climate positive. Users of the Mpowa platform can potentially utilize their contributions in a way to reduce their tax bill.	 	An additional token, the Mpowa Energy Coin, will be issued in late Q2 or Q3 of 2022. This currency will be created and used on the Steroid 4.0 blockchain network, which guarantees regulatory approval, scalability, and security. Proof of Green is provided by the Energy Web Foundation CCA Protocol. Tokens will be minted and mined on the global Mpowa HPC network with our first site likely being in RSA or Cyprus.   The ESG Fund is where all fiat contributions are held - whether from investors in the overall company fund, or project specific treasuries. This fund is controlled by our partner, Scaling Funds, with full FATCA and CRS compliance.




Vision
 Mpowa and its associates envision a future on earth where sufficient resources and ultimately abundance is realized and accessible for all. With sufficient resources, we refer to basic components for human life (not to be considered as luxuries) such as clean drinking water, sustainably farmed organic food, medical supplies, education, shelter and zero-emission energy / clean mobility.  	Clean water is a key-component for maintaining overall public health, whether it is used for drinking, domestic use, food production or recreational purposes. Improved clean-water supply and sanitation, and better management of water resources, can boost countries’ economic growth and can contribute greatly to poverty reduction, hence the focus on distributing water purification devices during the pilot projects.
The future of power generation is 100% sustainable and maintenance free. We believe everybody should have access to an abundant source of clean, carbon-neutral energy. Mpowa will contribute to the decentralization of power generation and return the power back to the people. Mpowa will create the first self-powering, carbon-neutral blockchain- based energy grid, based upon a global network of autonomous self-powering generator devices. 	The overall vision of Mpowa is a world of connected fully autonomous devices of various type which produce and consume their own energy, in some cases selling the surplus back to the grid (where local regulations and infrastructure permit), all registered with Energy Web Chain for unique identification of the device, whilst metered and paid for in Mpowa cryptocurrency tokens. 	Having achieved global mass adoption of our device and blockchain infrastructure, by definition, our utility token will in effect become a global digital “fully fungible energy based unit of account” currency (stablecoin) that can potentially be used as the international medium of exchange between national currencies – because energy consumption is the absolute holy grail indicator of economic activity and hence pure gold dust as far as economists and central bankers trying to define monetary and credit policy for their economies goes. This aligns well to the emerging trend of increased use of blockchain and AI within the financial sector for purposes of oversight and automation of the financial system and national currencies.  Sustainability is defined as the process of mankind's action to avoid the depletion of natural resources, to maintain the ecological balance and not to allow the quality of life to decline in today's modern society. A measure that does slightly less damage to the natural world, in the belief that ecosystems not only ensure that they continue to function and create the conditions that allow quality of life in modern society not to decline, but also to claim to be sustainable. Given the environmental and social problems faced by societies around the world, sustainability can be exploited in a specific way.  	Sustainability encourages people, politicians and businesses to make long-term decisions and take future generations into account. It encourages companies to make decisions about environmental, social and human impacts in the long term, rather than short-term profits. Sustainable development is the process of social progress that takes into account the needs of current and future generations by integrating economic, social and environmental considerations into decision-making. 	Companies that achieve corporate sustainability must reduce their emissions, reduce their energy consumption, source products from fair trade organizations, and ensure that their physical waste is disposed of with the lowest possible carbon footprint. Companies can make a public commitment to sustainability through measures such as waste reduction, investments in renewable energies and support organizations that offset carbon emissions. Even when big brands are committed to sustainability, it can take a long time to achieve sustainability goals, hence the creation of the carbon offset market to reach net-zero prior to demanding instant technological replacements to stop emissions. 















Mission
 Our long-term mission is to catalyze the mass adoption of new forms of clean sustainable energy and utilize the benefits of these technologies in best interest of the end-user. This is achieved by supporting the development and commercialization of disruptive new clean energy technologies. Ensuring that this technology won’t be corrupted by corporate monopolies or political agendas, Mpowa’s energy-generation devices connect to a decentralized autonomous platform, with its own currency.  	Mpowa is creating a platform for the world to combat energy scarcity and where every individual has the opportunity to choose energy sources that have no hidden side effects, in full respect of Health and Environment. By reducing or eliminating economic disparities caused by the lack of access to affordable clean energy, paired with decentralized technology to ensure social and environmental resilience. Mpowa is creating the foundation for an honest and equitable society. 	`The main objective of the pilot-project is to provide safe and sustainably available clean water, at locations where water-born diseases are a root cause for infant-mortality, e.g. rural areas of Africa. 	The goal is to also directly tackle fundamental socio-economic problems of energy scarcity, environmental destruction, financial exclusion, and help to mitigate/displace current CO2 intensive energy production technologies like coal and other fossil fuels. 
Besides tackling problems through solutions and partnerships presented by the Mpowa platform, it’s the companies’ mission to spark global creativity and submit/suggest new projects for a better future on earth, through rewarding community engagement.
