# Documents

This repository is assigned to bearing several documents related to the business approach, technology and company's vision. 

We believe in a world without energy and water scarcity, where the sources of both have no negative effect on our children's health or the environment.  We believe economic disparities must be eliminated, and that we must achieve social and environmental resilience.

This repository contains:

1. [The specification](spec.md) for everything.
2. A link to [the application](https://mpowa.io) you can use the app ([work in progress](https://mpowa.io)).
3. Start impacting [NFT](https://mpoiwa.io) you can build your own NFT.
4. [Certificates](#certs) official certs.
5. [Examples of projects](example-projects/) - tree planting etc.


To realise this vision the world needs to harness clean technologies and accelerate the decentralisation of energy and water provision, in line with UN Strategic Development Goals (SDGs).

## Whitepaper

Vulnerable communities in developing nations have limited to no incentive to maintain their local ecosystem and preserve the natural environment. Due to extreme poverty and exclusion, pollution, environmental degradation and carbon intensive activities (wood, charcoal, kerosene burning), these communities are unhealthy and dangerous places for children to grow up, with high infant mortality rates and incidence of preventable disease.
