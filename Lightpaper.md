## MPOWA - Democratising the clean tech revolution

### 1.0 Abstract
In the current global economic landscape of  resource constraints, energy inefficiency, lack of appropriate, relevant and scalable water purification systems - and where  climate concerns are no longer after-effect, but rather opportunities for fresh and sustainable business models - clean technology innovation has emerged as a key driver for economic growth. 

It is now apparent as well as imperative to invoke the disruptive potential of innovation and the vast untapped entrepreneurial spirit of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) and startups to achieve truly sustainable economic development.

While innovation drives economic growth, clean technology innovation is vital for the global economy to solve the externalities of climate change and build an effective sustainable development. When implemented properly, today's clean technology innovations will fuel the next industrial revolution that will have a footprint on tomorrow’s job market, global economy, and limit environmental degradation.

This paper introduces Mpowa, the first blockchain powered clean technology SaaS platform that aims to democratise the clean technology revolution. By combining the novel blockchain technology with the idea to build a clean technology SDG acceleration platform, Mpowa will simplify the conventional, complex process of funding impact projects; unlocking mass consumer adoption with an  innovative approach to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs). This will benefit  local communities and their surrounding environments, while allowing for rewards to be earned by investors in the projects in the form of carbon credits and other tokenisation benefits of the emerging Web3.0 economy.

### 2.0 Introduction
Throughout recorded history, technology has been the backbone of human progress. Currently, developing and deploying innovative clean energy solutions is vital to counter one of the biggest threats of our time: climate change. One would struggle to find a country today that is unaware of the effects of the excessive reliance on fossil fuels; from droughts to floods, the earth is crumbling under the pressure of years of rampant pollutive energy consumption.

However, clean technology (an umbrella that captures everything from sustainable resources to environmental protection projects) offers us a way out of this impending catastrophe. Clean technology deployment is the most efficient method to counter the adverse effects of climate change. In fact, clean technology is compatible and complementary to most of the UN SDGs (see figure X - insert photo of SDGs). 

Today, continuous innovation, development and widespread use of clean technology are essential to combat, prevent and restore damage to natural resources and the ecological systems upon which the prosperity of the current and the future generations of mankind depend.

The ability to deploy effective technologies on a broader scale to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions relies on two important aspects: the pace of technological innovation, and the direction of its deployment. Whereas, the direction of technological innovation largely depends on a neutral, balanced and sustainable approach to energy policy, the pace of technological innovation depends on a variety of factors which includes the presence of effective domestic policies to propel research and innovation. These policies are vital in major developing countries whose emissions are increasing and yet lack a well defined infrastructure for research and development. 

### 2.1 Climate change and the Developing World
According to a report by the US Global Leaders Coalition, 2020 has been the hottest year ever recorded. The year was tied with extreme weather conditions and record breaking climate-driven disasters, including the Australian bushfires that burned an estimated 18.6 million hectares of forest and hurricanes in the USA which caused $60bn worth of damage. While the global leadership on climate change is known for their multifaceted policy solutions, it is obvious that the disruption from flooding, drought, and extreme weather conditions reduces access to natural resources in the developing world. 

The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are likely to aggravate climate-driven challenges and retard efforts to subdue them. Climate disasters are known to overwhelm local health systems in developing countries, especially when they are already under extreme stress. 

In order to combat the said climate problem, a rapid reduction of the current emission levels as well as prevention of further emissions growth are vital. Only with the combination of both approaches can we accomplish the 2030 targets set by the Agenda for Sustainable Development. 

With new technologies being introduced into our world, opportunities for more sustainable ways of development abound. Mpowa believes that investment in these technologies, coupled with their application in developing economies and countries, will enhance the transition that will pave the way for the achievement of the SDGs. It is evident that the transition of the world’s energy sector from fossil based to zero carbon is now critical, vital and imperative. 

Overall, Mpowa supports the logic behind constant innovation in new technologies because the clean technology sector is the only pathway for sustainable land management, carbon sequestration and increased climate resilience. 

To address this challenge holistically, Mpowa is developing a highly scalable and comprehensive platform focused on supporting the deployment of promising clean technology innovations and entrepreneurship ecosystems at a global scale. The vision of the founders is for the Mpowa platform to bring together the most enterprising innovators and entrepreneurs to accelerate the NetZero transition, halting and reversing the devastation associated with climate change. 

In the table below, we show the impact of climate change on important sectors in the developing world.





### 2.2 Historical development and colonial history of Africa
                  	   Why we must put things in order and help Africa develop
The Berlin Conference in 1884-1885 institutionalised what has come to be known as the 'Scramble for Africa.' African territories were partitioned among European powers arbitrarily, and they began administering their newly established colonies. Seventy years later, they handed to indigenous Africans lands that looked nothing like they did in 1880. And, with a few notable exceptions, these countries are among the world's poorest today. Colonialism's imposition on Africa altered the course of its history irreversibly. African ways of thinking, patterns of cultural evolution, and ways of living were irreversibly altered by colonialism's alteration of the governmental framework. The Atlantic slave trade had a substantial impact on the African economy, as did imperialism and the economic policies that accompanied colonialism. Prior to the scramble for Africa, African economies were developing in many sectors, most notably commerce. Colonialism's objective is to exploit an area's physical, human, and economic resources for the advantage of the colonising nation. European powers pursued this objective by promoting the creation of a commodity-based trading system, a cash crop agricultural system, and by establishing a trade network connecting a region's whole economic output to the colonial state's needs. The growth of colonialism and the division of Africa by European colonial powers stymied the African economic system's natural development. Africa was not economically isolated from the rest of the globe prior to colonisation. Indeed, African governments have participated in international commerce from the time of the ancient Egyptian pharaohs, and West Africa in particular built vast international trading systems throughout the Ghana, Mali, and Songhai dynasties. These colossal empires depended primarily on foreign trade taxes to fund government spending. These nations' income was derived mostly from gold trading, but also from the imposition of customs, taxes, loot from foreign expeditions, and administrative fees.
Developing countries like Africa have little option but to integrate into global markets in order to keep up with the present rate of globalisation. Due to the history of European colonisation, Africa has more than its fair share of small, impoverished economies, making it the continent most prone to ethnic-based hostilities. In addition to their natural barriers, African countries create the most obtrusive man-made obstacles. The Historical development and colonial past of Africa definitely put it in a disadvantageous position over other economies. Africa is at a crossroads in its history. It is currently in the forefront of development challenges that its leaders are concerned about. This is why we must put things in order to help Africa develop.

### 2.3 To Help Africa Develop: The Clean Tech Initiative
The New Climate Economy demonstrated, on a global scale, that climate action and economic development can go hand in hand, and that they can be achieved independently. Applying these principles to the African context, and taking a thorough look at the continent's potential for green growth, and programs that  can assist small and medium-sized businesses in leveraging clean technology provide more opportunities for this promising continent.Clean tech has all it takes to change Africa.
At Mpowa, we believe that investments in clean technology innovation and its wider impacts are critical to shaping the myriad challenges confronting Africa, along with investments in complementary assets such as sustainable infrastructure, human, natural, and social capital, which will not only contribute to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions, but will also improve the productivity of the people, boost their living standards, and open up more opportunities for the people. Also,with good policies that acknowledge the intimate linkages between economic, social, and clean technology innovation agendas can result in significant advantages over the long term for all parties involved. Mpowa stands solidly in this, as  the COVID-19 outbreak has demonstrated the extent to which many people in Africa face food and energy shortages. Clean technologies can assist African nations develop resilience to and recovery from future calamities by helping them to determine sustainable ways of leap frogging from the shackles of colonialism and economic quagmire.

### 2.4 DAO Governance, Democratisation, Breaking down silos and Monopolistic Practices
Global warming cannot be denied as a threat to humanity's present and future. Countless measures have been launched worldwide to stop its progression, including 26 Conferences of Parties (COP) gatherings since the 1992 Rio Earth Summit. Thus far, two characteristics have defined these large-scale initiatives and agreements. To begin, there has been an excessive dependence on politicians and large businesses to set the agenda. Second, the gatherings have a history of overpromising and under delivering on action. Hence, a huge percentage of the world population feels excluded from deliberations on such a critical issue. Additionally, the sustainability movement has progressed in stops and starts, rarely accomplishing its aims and objectives. This situation must be drastically improved for material progress to be made, a task that Mpowa has taken on explicitly.

### 2.5 DAO Governance, Breaking Silos and the Monopoly in Climate Action
Climate paradigms are beginning to emerge as a result of the development of new decentralisation tools. Blockchain, DAO, and Web3 are the organisations and internet of the future.  These models promise a new radically democratised end-to-end sustainability-as-a-service solution that will empower and reward everyone including individuals, businesses, and protocols alike to be good environmental stewards. DAO and democracy allow anyone to participate and transparently showcase, invest in, and actualize climate action through blockchain technology on efficient market terms at any scale. This eliminates silos and monopolistic practices that have hindered climate initiative and clean tech in the pursuit of the Paris Accord and the SDGs.
DAO governance and democratisation, applied to the commercialisation of  disruptive clean technology will enable us to establish an innovation nexus capable of rapidly coordinating and implementing high-impact sustainability initiatives, standardising best practices across the impact investment sector, and mobilising a community of technical experts with both the capability, resources, and data driven insights, to more effectively accelerate action.  Furthermore, a DAO governance model enables network users across the globe to vote on governance issues such as whether to accept specific carbon offsets or auditors, to accept data from an audited emissions channel, and to upgrade emissions accounting models. For instance, they can determine if offset tokens issued by a given certifying entity are legitimate offsets. They can vote on exchange rates or bonding curves to determine the relative value of various offsets. They could vote on whether or not to alter emissions factors or methodology for calculating emissions on the emission channels. Opening up access to climate actions and clean technology through DAO and democratisation eliminates monopolies, bureaucratic break silos, and bearers, allowing everyone on the planet to participate in the value chain of environmental stewardship. Climate change is both a financial, management and administrative problem. Each year, hundreds of billions of dollars are still invested in oil and gas, despite the existence of viable alternatives for generating energy and producing goods and services. Globally, there is a consensus that action is necessary, but we remain in stasis. To gain a firm grasp on the tasks at hand, we must address these constraints. To effect the necessary change, we need to mobilise and coordinate those who can contribute and those who wish to participate immediately and broadly. Change must be managed horizontally and collaboratively, not top-down by unaccountable leaders.

### 2.6 DAO Governance and Tokenization
Tokenizing carbon credits will not only expand project developers' access to capital sources, but also enable them to use DeFi applications, exponentially increasing the liquidity available to those taking on-the-ground action to meet the Paris Agreement's target of limiting global warming to 1.5°C. The governance of DAOs, blockchain technology, non-fungible tokens, and Web3 lays the groundwork for establishing a worldwide market for carbon emissions, enabling peer-to-peer trading of carbon credits and direct connectivity to the Internet of Things. Combining the governance capabilities of DAOs and NFTs with the on-chain locking of various types of carbon credits is expected to promote price discovery in the carbon market and unleash liquidity from both traditional funders and the Decentralised Finance (DeFi) ecosystem.

### 2.7 The Importance of Transformation at Scale
Blockchain technology as we know it today, has the potential to enable new ways of managing our resources, achieving interoperability across networks, and the ability to completely transform the current state of affairs in climate and clean tech initiatives. It serve as the foundation for efficiently allocating resources, outpacing old bureaucratic and political processes, and eliminating the need to jump through hoops to participate in the clean tech and low carbon economy. Without blockchain and Web3.0, it would have been exceedingly difficult, if not impossible, to form a global community of individuals working together to combat climate change and implement clean technology. However, DAOs have revolutionised all.

### 2.8 Historical References to Amazing Technologies that did not get Commercialised due to Market Resistance and Wrong Investors
There have been several tremendous technical, economic, and societal developments throughout the last century. The complete development and diffusion of technological breakthroughs such as electricity, telephones, and vehicles occurred together with the birth of mass production, consumption, and commercialization. The capacity to commercialise technology, to swiftly and efficiently get a product from concept to market, is critical in light of changing global business conditions. One of the ironies of industrial innovation is that strong market potential is a risk element that must be considered when launching a new product, as new items make larger demands on company resources. A company's success is determined on its ability to market its product.  Commercialization failures can result not only in the failure of a product, but also in the collapse of a business. In most cases, unsuccessful technology commercialization is the consequence of failures in one of three key areas: product, strategy, or experience-related variables.
The rise of cleantech is critical because the world lacks the technology necessary to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Climate warming will be confined to 2° C over pre-industrial levels based on today's cleantech investments. Clean technology is considered as crucial for resolving or at the very least ameliorating the environmental and energy crisis the world is facing today, without jeopardising prospects for advancement and economic prosperity. This is not to say, however, that sustainable development can be achieved easily with a 'technological fix.' Innovation and commercialization of new technologies are inherently unpredictable processes that frequently fail. Technology commercialization models are frequently linear, based on a technology-push logic, and hyper-focused on micro-level aspects such as technology and product attributes, entrepreneurial experience, and resource availability.
Cleantech has historically been an unpredictable investment industry, with booms and busts throughout the years. After a modest start in 2001-2004, investors began pouring billions of dollars into cleantech start-ups with the goal of disrupting the energy business and reducing carbon emissions. This was followed by significant cleantech technical advancements that never saw the light of day. Silicon Valley funded cleantech in the early 2000s with little grasp of the sectors that this new technology will serve. After billions of dollars were lost, top Silicon Valley venture capitalists concluded that cleantech and venture capital were incompatible. The most prominent of these failures was Solyndra, a solar business, declared bankruptcy in 2011 after receiving $535 million in government-backed loans in the United States. Along with the cleantech bubble in the early 2000, the following are some amazing technologies that did not get commercialised because of market resistance and wrong investors as was the case of Tesla and cleantech VC funding from Silicon Valley;
Ford Edsel        	                                               Tech Malfunction
HD DVD            	                                                Vonage
Amazon's Fire Phone                  	                          Sony Betamax
Microsoft Vista                              	                           Gateway
RJ Reynolds smokeless cigarettes 	                Apple Newton
Nintendo's Virtual Boy                                     	     Microsoft Zune
Numerous high-profile and well-funded technology launches over the last several years have failed. This category contains start-ups and products introduced by known companies that did not succeed in commercialization owing to market barriers and poor investment decisions. Quite frequently, strategies do not translate into success. They may have invented something new in the field of technology, or they may have demonstrated the polar opposite. In either case, these products/service providers are among the most egregious technological failures ever created.

### 3.0 Problems affecting cleantech growth
Over the last decade, the energy sector has progressed slowly due to minimal innovation from entrepreneurial startup firms. Yearly, we experience significant performance improvements and cost declines in renewable energy technologies. To replace the surplus amount of fossil fuels with alternative, carbon free energy sources such as solar, wind, it will require long term cleantech solutions and perhaps, smart grid technologies. 
However, there are several unique features of the energy sector that impedes growth, making innovation extremely challenging. 
In the book, Planetary Improvement by Jesse Goldstein, he argues that: “The reason that cleantech innovation has been so ill suited for venture funding is the lengthy time it takes to develop energy technologies. It is a slow moving field, on the technology side at least, relative to the pace of expected returns on capital investment. Many of the largest venture capital firms have taken a beating with their cleantech holdings, and have to reevaluate their investment models - looking for longer term horizons and more patient capital. This idea that patient capital(capital willing to forgo liquidity for longer periods of time and therefore willing to increase the risk of lower annualised rate of returns) is the missing ingredient in cleantech’s innovation ecosystem, has led to a renewed interest in active state involvement in supporting the commercialization and development of new technologies.”
Before delving further into a summarised problems retarding the growth of cleantech sector, it is important to discuss about the unique features of the energy industry that differentiates the process of technological change in the sector as described by the NBER working series titled Innovation and Entrepreneurship in the Energy Sector:

Energy is a commodity. Consumers want the lights to go on when they flip a switch. While environmental considerations are becoming more important to consumers in many countries, most do not care about the source of that energy, and are unwilling to pay a premium for clean energy. As a result, successful entrepreneurs cannot fully capture the rents associated with differentiating their product. Instead, reducing costs is the measure of successful innovation. 
 Regulation plays an important role in the industry. Electrical and gas service is usually distributed by regulated natural monopolies, and regulation of energy production varies across jurisdictions. Because consumers focus on cost rather than quality, until recently cleaner energy sources such as solar or wind were viewed as too expensive in the absence of interventions to address externalities. Unlike sectors where the government is a primary consumer (such as the military or space exploration), energy is somewhat unique in that government regulation shapes demand, but final consumption decisions are made in the private sectors. As a result, uncertainty over future policy can dampen incentives for R&D. 
 Energy generation is capital intensive. Economies of scale are pervasive in large power plants. For example, new natural gas-fired combined cycle plants are three times as large as similar plants built in the 1980s, leading to lower costs per kilowatt. Demonstrating commercial viability of a new energy production technology requires hundreds of millions of dollars, making entry into the industry difficult for small start-up firms. 
 Long time horizons between initial idea and commercialization in the energy sector also make it more difficult for small start-up firms to raise capital. Venture capital investors expect returns within three to five years of their investments. But the development and testing of new energy technologies takes longer. 
Overall, the problems with cleantech and the general growth in the energy sector as a whole can be summarised into the following:
Growth in Cleantech platforms degraded due to decreased innovation from entrepreneurial startup firms.
The long time and dedication needed to develop clean technology innovations has led to low investment from venture capitals.
Gaining entry into cleantech energy production requires a large amount of capital which most times, is unaffordable by small firms.
Angel investors who are a vital source of funding are relatively rare in africa(especially the sub sahara) and also lack geographical or sectorial experience of their investees.
Access to talents is getting harder as cleantech founders find professionals to be more attached to the prestige of working with larger corporations.

### 3.1 An End-to-End Ecosystem Solution
Globalisation processes and the emergence of new technologies such as blockchain and Web3 have paved the way for end-to-end engagements and ecosystem interoperability. Interoperability and collaboration across diverse actors in carbon impact and SGDs are necessary in the struggle to save our planet from the hazards posed by climate change and greenhouse gases. Specifically, with the use of DAO and unified tokenomics protocols, actions and initiatives aimed at these areas may be completely quantified, accessed, monitored, and funds appropriately utilised
To ensure that market resistance factors and bad investments do not devastate today's clean technology sector, and that they are eliminated, so that we may have a seamless integrated energy flow across and between platforms and diverse actors. Mpowa, a blockchain-based clean technology SaaS platform, is leveraging DAO to democratise the clean technology revolution by merging unique blockchain technology with the vision of a clean technology SDG acceleration platform. Mpowa's new approach to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals will simplify the usual, complex method of supporting impact initiatives, enabling widespread consumer acceptance and seamless tracking of progress towards the SDGs. This benefits local communities and the surrounding environment, while also allowing investors in the projects to reap rewards in the form of carbon credits and other tokenisation benefits associated with the growing Web3.0 economy.
3.2 Why an end-to-end ecosystem solution is essential?
In 2015, the United Nations (UN) member states adopted 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) with the goal of achieving them by 2030. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are an urgent global call to action that serve as a framework for shared prosperity in a sustainable future. To achieve these SDGs, blockchain technology is a critical enabler, as it enables accountability, transparency, traceability, and cyber-resilience, as well as increased operational efficiency in global partnerships.
Today, distributed ledger technology (DLT) is a step toward the so-called Web 3.0, or the Internet of Value. This next Internet era will have a peer-to-peer economy powered by crowdsourced data sharing technologies. A blockchain is a subset of DLT that consists of timestamped blocks of transactions that are connected together by cryptographic hashes. The blockchain architecture provides benefits in terms of security, privacy, non-repudiation, integrity, accountability, transparency, robustness, and authentication. Additionally, it maximises operational efficiency by avoiding the use of centralised parties and/or middlemen. To provide an integrated energy flow across and between the platform's many players, as well as a unified tokenomics that assesses and monetises both carbon and SDG effect. Through the combination of web3 technology and a decentralised token economy, the Mpowa solution disrupts established business models by establishing appropriate multilateral solutions that handle market resistance and commercialization challenges.
3.3 But why should we care so much about Climate change and Clean Energy solutions?
Over the years, a growing number of studies are reiterating that climate change could be dangerous for the bottom lines of companies in the world. Moreover, developing countries, which is our major target market, will need about $100 billion of new investments per year for the next 40 years in order to build counter measures to the effect of climate change.

Besides, a report in the journal nature found out that rampant warming could reduce average global incomes by nearly a quarter while another report by the Citi group pointed out that it could also shrink up to $72 trillion off the global gross domestic product.

Without pretending to be an alien, we’re already experiencing the effects. The severity of climate change is influencing the earth’s natural system. Climate change has been attributed to more than 150 000 deaths annually. From fires to hurricanes, drought and floods, climate change also contributes to ocean acidification, desertification, reduced air quality, and loss of biodiversity that impacts the economy and human society in an intense way.

### 3.4 Are there opportunities in Cleantech?
The most interesting part of cleantech innovations is that technical background is not a barrier to entry. One doesn’t need to be a tech giant before profiting from eco-friendly technologies. However, the rate at which developing countries need clean energy is quite alarming. The three most crucial aspects with strong impact potential on human and the rural environment are clean cooking, transition to renewables and access to electricity.

Globally, the number of people without access to electricity will decline to 660 million by 2030, but about 85% (550 million) of those people will live in sub saharan Africa. It is worthy to note that the lack of the right systems and purchasing power in rural communities has made the subsector to be over reliant on public funding. 

Nevertheless, opportunities abound, especially in the developing economies, for mechanisation through clean energy innovations. Implementations of decentralised renewable appliances such as chillers, solar powered pumps, clean water filters and milking machines for the massive agricultural markets in Africa can be made economically available. 

In recent years, the transition to renewables including wind and solar for electricity generation has soared higher in African countries and the trend is set to continue. From 2018 to 2040, African electricity generation is projected to double with the share of renewables increasing from 21% to 40% but broader uptake remains low due to high upfront costs and many other factors.

Although the consensus of all UN member states has laid a blueprint to prioritise almost all these issues, Mpowa is focusing on some major ones such as affordable and clean energy, economic growth, social and environmental resilience as well as a future that the sources of both energy and water has no negative impact on our children.

We believe the United Nations cannot handle it all alone. Most especially when the recent pandemic has raised the stakes for the need of clean energy. Energy investment has fallen globally by 18% in 2020 according to the International Energy Agency whereas, the pandemic has left a huge blow that has driven the growth of clean energy in Africa into reverse. 

On the contrary, the opportunities associated with clean energy are massive, considering the high stakes and the potential for significant growth. In fact, on a large scale, the clean energy sector has attracted many investor interests during the post pandemic recovery. Over $200 million went to energy startups in Africa, the leading global destination for offgrid startups.  Despite this significant growth, a major funding gap remains. The World Economic Forum explained that Africa’s off grid solar sector alone represents a $24 billion annual opportunity but there are still challenges with funding startups and supporting more local entrepreneurs in the cleantech sector.

Mpowa aims to remove the biggest barrier facing clean energy entrepreneurs. In a survey conducted by Endeavour Insight, access to capital is the severe or major obstacle retarding their businesses to reach maximum impact and profitable growth stage. 



### 4.0 Mpowa Solution
In order to combat the adverse effects of climate change through clean technologies, Mpowa solutions can be categorised into the followings:

Cleantech Entrepreneurship and Innovation Hub:
Mpowa will facilitate entrepreneurship and green innovation hubs that are focused on finding and empowering cleantech entrepreneurs and innovators. This will be achieved by enabling capacity within national institutions and partner organisations. Thus, Mpowa will be able to partner with the national policy makers to strengthen the policies around sustainable technologies.  

When the idea of innovators are combined with an effective accelerator approach, Mpowa will catalyse the investments in cleantech by helping founders from the ideation to the commercialisation of their ideas.



Innovation and Entrepreneurship Cross-sectional and Multi-tiered approach: We believe in sharing and acquiring knowledge beyond borders hence, one of the foundational construct we will employ in building an enabling environment for cleantech and entrepreneurship is by leveraging on the knowledge of international partners, well established nations and NGOs to strengthen the competency of cleantech-focused startups.

### 5.0 Mpowa platform overview

 
### 6.0 Platform features

### 7.0 Mpowa technology/Technology stack

Overview of the technology that is used, modified and written in order for the Mpowa platform to function as it is supposed to. The Substrate client is the software that runs the blockchain node, it includes the following components: storage, runtime, p2p network, consensus, RPC, telemetry. 
Blockchain Tech 
Plugging into a multi-chain framework. Mpowa is utilising Party Technology’s Substrate Node pallet to create a blockchain that is fully customizable to what the company needs. 118 Substrate can be described as a blockchain framework — specifically, a framework for building customized blockchains. These blockchains can be run entirely autonomously, which means they don't depend on any external technology to run That means Polkadot can be used as a kind of bridge between blockchains, taking care of the communication layer between chains and making it possible to interact between different blockchains (even systems such as Ethereum and Bitcoin). This represents significant progress toward making the vision of Web3 — a decentralized, blockchain-based version of the internet — a reality. Since they were developed by the same people, Substrate has first-class support for integrating with Polkadot, so any blockchain you create with Substrate can seamlessly be hooked into Polkadot. An Ethereum compatible smart-contract Parachain on Polkadot. 
Substrate Chain 
Runtime The runtime of a blockchain is the business logic that defines its behavior. In Substrate-based chains, the runtime is referred to as the "state transition function"; it is where Substrate developers define the storage items that are used to represent the blockchain's state as well as the functions that allow blockchain users to make changes to this state. Each Substrate node contains a runtime. The runtime contains the business logic of the chain. It defines what transactions are valid and invalid and determines how the chain's state changes in response to transactions. The "outer node", everything other than the runtime, does not compile to Wasm, only to native. The outer node is responsible for handling peer discovery, transaction pooling, block and transaction gossiping, consensus, and answering RPC calls from the outside world. While performing these tasks, the outer node sometimes needs to query the runtime for information, or provide information to the runtime. A 119 Runtime API facilitates this kind of communication between the outer node and the runtime.
 
### 8.0 How it works

### 9.0 Vision and Mission
Our Vision
We believe in a world where living with a good quality of life should have no negative impact on the environment we inhabit. We believe that our children’s health and the sustainability and well being of the environment should not turn to adversity because of our actions.  We believe economic disparities must be eliminated, and that we must achieve social and environmental resilience, in a sustainable manner. To realise this vision the world needs to harness clean technologies and accelerate the decentralisation of energy and water provision, in line with the UN SDGs.  

Our Mission
Leveraging  state of the art technologies to empower vulnerable communities by connecting clean technology projects with more funding opportunities and ensure universal access to clean water, energy, health infrastructure and nutrition. By creating an ecosystem that is well rigged for social impact, we will help reach the SDGs and support creative ideas that aim to help the world solve energy problems. Overall, our mission is to build a fully fledged ecosystem that rewards project funders and investors with the highly profitable financial incentives. In exchange for funding clean technology projects, carbon credits are generated, tokenized and issued to funders, investors and act as rewards for those facilitating the project.
