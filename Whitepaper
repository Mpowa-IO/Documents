Mpowa Ltd Whitepaper | Version 1.0

Preface

This blockchain-based interactive SaaS platform, 
is contrived to stimulate society to collectively ensure global resource sufficiency and accessibility for sustainable healthy living. 
Aiming to serve humanity as a whole, on the increasingly more turbulent and polluted planet earth. 
Averting unnecessary illness and death is the most important reason for Mpowa’s existence,
as every human being should ideally be able to live in a healthy way. 
By continually increasing the Energy Flux Density, resource abundance is within reach. 
Mpowa does not agree to the general consensus of mandatory vaccination and consumption control in order to reduce emissions. 

By also empowering externally organized SDG-oriented clean-tech projects to present themselves on the platform,
Mpowa facilitates the industry with a high-standard GTM opportunity, 
while also permitting low-cap / high-value projects to raise the necessary funding to succeed.
Transparency and auditability are key features of blockchain technology, 
which provide traceability of funds (resource allocation can be tracked from start to finish) and verifiable Proof of Impact.
Constant transparency and credibility also differentiates the SaaS platform from established competitors and well known large-scale 
foundations that utilize traditional banking technology. 
Mpowa’s data-driven approach is in line with UN’s DSDs to match the United Nations National Quality Assurance Frameworks Manual for Official Statistics. 
By utilizing blockchain technology, 
Mpowa provides an additional credibility layer to ensure data quality, transparency of set definitions and important terms and 
project methodology towards contributors and auditors.

Introduction

This introduction will entail Mpowa’s core purpose, its SaaS-platform functionality with the appurtenant financial flow, 
alongside complementary information such as strategic goals, partnerships (consortium) and research data.
Written to inform the readers about the company and the complementary DAO, 
in order to increase the readers’ knowledge and create a valuable risk-assessment. 
MPOWA Ltd is exclusively a technology company, with all financial activity provided by third parties. 
MPOWA Ltd is not controlled or owned by any other organization which provides financial services. 
	The future of (cash) money will predominantly be digital, hence Mpowa’s choice of utilizing blockchain technology. 
Global adoption of blockchain technology to gain financial sovereignty through tokens, 
tokenized assets and DeFi applications is increasing at a fast pace. Also notable are the upcoming central bank digital currencies (CDBC), 
after many years of resistance. 
	As the regulatory and technological maturity levels stabilize globally in preparation for the mass adoption of these new digital technologies,
Mpowa is planning to develop and launch a suite of digital tokens covering three major use cases: investment, data and payments. 
Each token is designed to address specific aspects of the NetZero transition to a sustainable circular economy, 
with the investment and data tokens working in tandem to provide end-to-end traceability of ESG investment flows from 
external funds through to the underlying economy as measured physically via IoT sensors and consecutively reported through defined SDG parameters. 
	Additionally, Mpowa’s goal is to launch an ISO20022 compliant zero carbon payment token for energy generation and 
consumption in Q3 of 2022, minted and mined on a global and distributed trustless network of interconnected Zero-Emission crypto-mining devices. 
This is realized through partnerships with Energy Web Foundation Crypto Climate Accord and Steroid 4.0 blockchain, amongst others.    

Transparency and auditability are key features of blockchain technology, which provide traceability of funds (resource allocation) and 
verifiable Proof of Impact. Through monitoring and verifying project-data on the blockchain, 
Mpowa initiates a global quality standard for the issuance of (Tokenized) Carbon Offset Credits, 
preventing double-selling and realizing real-time / direct offset. Customers won’t be purchasing project-approximation credits, 
but merely verified and realized tokenized Carbon Offset Credits. By creating the platform, Mpowa facilitates the clean-tech industry with
a high-standard GTM opportunity, while also permitting low-cap / high-value projects to raise the necessary funding to succeed.
	
Through acquisition and spending of Mpowa’s Utility Token the users’ contributions will be submitted to project-fund pools, from which the designated parties will receive their share according to the product or service that is or will be delivered, in order to start or complete a project. Depending on the amount that is being contributed or the type of contribution, the user may receive an additional SDG Impact Token or a Non-Fungible Token (a certificate linking to the products that they’ve purchased for a beneficiary family). For certain projects, Tokenized Carbon Offset Credits will be distributed once the offset is realized. Data Tokens and Data-Logging Tokens are interlinked to specific NFT’s that facilitate the offset. These various ways of contributing to listed projects, are more thoroughly described in the sections ‘’The Platform’’ and ‘’Tokenomics’’. 
	Project-fund pools are better formulated as smart-contracts, which are financial software-programs that are continuously running on the blockchain, once deployed. This will be further elucidated in the chapter ‘’The Technology’’. 	All contributions will be acquired from verified platform-users, which have successfully submitted their necessary information through the implemented KYC-protocol, in order to ensure an entirely legitimate stack of contributions to ensure regulatory compliance. Mpowa has a strict and correct privacy policy to ensure safety of their users’ data. Not all data will be stored on the blockchain, yet shall be encrypted to prevent data-theft. 	Most contributions, with presumably different financial values, will have unique and fair voting properties carried with it, concerning projects and questions that are presented by the Mpowa-DAO. After purchase, these voting rights will become available for the contributor, through Governance Tokens. These project specific voting rights will be different for every project and every donation, carrying different properties that will be clearly described in the receipt before the users confirm their project-contribution. Read more about these voting properties in the chapter “DAO’’. Please note that the voting rights / Governance Tokens that may be granted to the contributor from acquiring a token or tokens only applies to matters/projects concerning the DAO and are not equal to possessing equity or shareholder-rights in the company, Mpowa Ltd, itself.
For a detailed disclaimer on token purchases, please read the chapter ‘’Disclaimer’’ and consult the additional documents available on the Mpowa website, or the documents provided by the approved exchanges that have listed Mpowa’s tokens. 	There are various methods to acquire the tokens that are issued by Mpowa, all which are described in the chapter ‘’Tokenomics’’. Every contributor should consult with independent tax advisors as to the consequences of receiving the Mpowa Token(s).  	It is anticipated that the value of the token(s) will fluctuate over time, except the Mpowa Utility Token (stablecoin) - which is 1:1 pegged with the Euro fiat currency. After delivery, the value of the tokens may be determined based on current pricing on third-party exchanges, and in the absence of such pricing, the price of the tokens may be limited to what a buyer is willing to pay in a privately negotiated arms-length transaction. The company is not under any obligation to provide token valuations to purchasers and provides no guarantees that it will take affirmative steps to facilitate a secondary market for the tokens. There can be no guarantee that the tokens will hold their value or increase in value. Many factors will influence this outcome, including increased activity on the blockchain, demand for the blockchain’s services as blockchain projects proliferate, and other factors that are outside of the company’s control.  The first token we are launching is the Mpowa Utility Token (stablecoin for project contributions), followed by a security token, the Mpowa SDG Impact Token - linked to the Mpowa Carbon Fund. This is an investment grade digital financial asset that is fully regulatory compliant and linked to our Luxembourg domiciled AIFM ESG fund launched in partnership with Scaling Funds. The Mpowa Utility Tokens are used in the Decarbonizer.app and the Decarbonizer Pro services to fund projects via the platform and provide complete traceability of funds from investors to impact via the blockchain. Depending on the project and contribution size, a certain amount of Mpowa SDG Impact Tokens will be transferred to the contributor. 	All Mpowa Tokens can used by enterprises, NGOs, charities and consumers to support ESG-related energy and water projects in line with 17 SDGs. The SDG Impact Tokens and Tokenized Carbon Credits are minted dynamically, according to the projects capacity.
The cryptocurrencies created by Mpowa are among the first (crypto)currencies to be born as carbon negative, climate positive. Users of the Mpowa platform can potentially utilize their contributions in a way to reduce their tax bill.	 	An additional token, the Mpowa Energy Coin, will be issued in late Q2 or Q3 of 2022. This currency will be created and used on the Steroid 4.0 blockchain network, which guarantees regulatory approval, scalability, and security. Proof of Green is provided by the Energy Web Foundation CCA Protocol. Tokens will be minted and mined on the global Mpowa HPC network with our first site likely being in RSA or Cyprus.   The ESG Fund is where all fiat contributions are held - whether from investors in the overall company fund, or project specific treasuries. This fund is controlled by our partner, Scaling Funds, with full FATCA and CRS compliance.




Vision
 Mpowa and its associates envision a future on earth where sufficient resources and ultimately abundance is realized and accessible for all. 
With sufficient resources, we refer to basic components for human life (not to be considered as luxuries) such as clean drinking water, 
sustainably farmed organic food, medical supplies, education, shelter and zero-emission energy / clean mobility. 
Clean water is a key-component for maintaining overall public health, whether it is used for drinking, domestic use, 
food production or recreational purposes. Improved clean-water supply and sanitation, and better management of water resources, 
can boost countries’ economic growth and can contribute greatly to poverty reduction, hence the focus on distributing water purification devices 
during the pilot projects.
The future of power generation is 100% sustainable and maintenance free.
 We believe everybody should have access to an abundant source of clean, carbon-neutral energy. 
Mpowa will contribute to the decentralization of power generation and return the power back to the people. 
Mpowa will create the first self-powering, carbon-neutral blockchain- based energy grid, based upon a global network of autonomous 
self-powering generator devices.
The overall vision of Mpowa is a world of connected fully autonomous devices of various type which produce and consume their own energy,
 in some cases selling the surplus back to the grid (where local regulations and infrastructure permit), 
all registered with Energy Web Chain for unique identification of the device, whilst metered and paid for in Mpowa cryptocurrency tokens.
Having achieved global mass adoption of our device and blockchain infrastructure, by definition, 
our utility token will in effect become a global digital “fully fungible energy based unit of account” currency (stablecoin) that can potentially be used as the international medium of exchange between national currencies – because energy consumption is the absolute holy grail indicator of economic activity and hence pure gold dust as far as economists and central bankers trying to define monetary and credit policy for their economies goes. This aligns well to the emerging trend of increased use of blockchain and AI within the financial sector for purposes of oversight and automation of the financial system and national currencies.  Sustainability is defined as the process of mankind's action to avoid the depletion of natural resources, to maintain the ecological balance and not to allow the quality of life to decline in today's modern society. A measure that does slightly less damage to the natural world, in the belief that ecosystems not only ensure that they continue to function and create the conditions that allow quality of life in modern society not to decline, but also to claim to be sustainable. Given the environmental and social problems faced by societies around the world, sustainability can be exploited in a specific way.  	Sustainability encourages people, politicians and businesses to make long-term decisions and take future generations into account. It encourages companies to make decisions about environmental, social and human impacts in the long term, rather than short-term profits. Sustainable development is the process of social progress that takes into account the needs of current and future generations by integrating economic, social and environmental considerations into decision-making. 	Companies that achieve corporate sustainability must reduce their emissions, reduce their energy consumption, source products from fair trade organizations, and ensure that their physical waste is disposed of with the lowest possible carbon footprint. Companies can make a public commitment to sustainability through measures such as waste reduction, investments in renewable energies and support organizations that offset carbon emissions. Even when big brands are committed to sustainability, it can take a long time to achieve sustainability goals, hence the creation of the carbon offset market to reach net-zero prior to demanding instant technological replacements to stop emissions. 















Mission
 Our long-term mission is to catalyze the mass adoption of new forms of clean sustainable energy and utilize the benefits of these technologies in best interest of the end-user. This is achieved by supporting the development and commercialization of disruptive new clean energy technologies. Ensuring that this technology won’t be corrupted by corporate monopolies or political agendas, Mpowa’s energy-generation devices connect to a decentralized autonomous platform, with its own currency.  	Mpowa is creating a platform for the world to combat energy scarcity and where every individual has the opportunity to choose energy sources that have no hidden side effects, in full respect of Health and Environment. By reducing or eliminating economic disparities caused by the lack of access to affordable clean energy, paired with decentralized technology to ensure social and environmental resilience. Mpowa is creating the foundation for an honest and equitable society. 	`The main objective of the pilot-project is to provide safe and sustainably available clean water, at locations where water-born diseases are a root cause for infant-mortality, e.g. rural areas of Africa. 	The goal is to also directly tackle fundamental socio-economic problems of energy scarcity, environmental destruction, financial exclusion, and help to mitigate/displace current CO2 intensive energy production technologies like coal and other fossil fuels. 
Besides tackling problems through solutions and partnerships presented by the Mpowa platform, it’s the companies’ mission to spark global creativity and submit/suggest new projects for a better future on earth, through rewarding community engagement.  

Long term: 
... 


Values
 Mpowa aims to create genuine relationships with its customers by giving them the opportunity to really change human-lives for the better.  
The Mpowa Team, being at its core humanitarian libertarians, fundamentally believes in the principles espoused in the US Declaration of Independence 
– that all humanity should have the right to Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness. For far too long these inherent rights are abridged, 
curtailed and threatened by the state and out of control economic and political actors.  	To supplement these fundamental rights, 
FDR famously spoke of the 4 freedoms: Freedom of association, Freedom of conscience, Freedom from fear and, last but not least, Freedom from want. 
It is in the last of these - in the field of energy systems - that we aim to make a fundamental shift in world socio-economic affairs from the present
 system of manufactured for-profit scarcity for the advantage of corporations to a system of autonomous energy abundance for the liberation of humanity.
 In doing so, we aim to tackle fundamental socio-economic problems of energy scarcity, environmental destruction, and help to mitigate/displace 
current CO2 intensive energy production technologies like coal power.   Sovereignty   The idea of sovereignty is closely related to the idea of freedom. 
The sovereign is the only one who is free. He may be a king or queen, but he is also the only one who can make decisions without consulting anyone else.
 	The idea of sovereignty is one that has been debated for centuries. It is a complicated concept, and many people have different views on 
what it means to be sovereign. The meaning of sovereignty changes depending on the context in which it is used. Sovereignty can be used as a 
synonym for independence or autonomy, but it can also refer to the legal right of a state to govern itself without outside interference. 
	For this purpose, sovereignty is defined as the ability to choose  



Equality

The world is changing and as such, we need to change the way we think about equality. We should not be focused on equality for the sake of equality,
 but instead focus on abundance and respect. 	Leaders cannot keep asking for more and more without giving anything in return. 
Mpowa is here to create a balance between what we give and what we get.

Abundance

Fullness manifests itself in many other ways, and not only as an abundance of money and an abundance of goods. 
Those with an abundance mindset believe that there is an abundance of everything in the world, from resources, love, 
relationships, wealth, and opportunity. Those with an abundance mindset are often visionaries and see limitless possibilities in the world.   
	Those with an abundance mindset are known for thinking big, it's part of their DNA. 
Because of the positive attitude of people with rich mindsets, they take an active approach to life. 
A person with an abundance mindset understands that change is an integral part of life, accepts and accepts change.   
	As in science, progress in life is much easier when you are willing to let go of past beliefs and embrace change. 
Thinking broadly also requires us to let go of past beliefs and assumptions and be open to new facts and ideas. 
Enriched thinking is based on the desire to change our thinking patterns and make room for new ones.    
	If you want to make significant changes in your life, you need to be honest about your way of thinking. 
Think about how the practice affects your future life and dreams.  
It is also contagious and generative, creating a thriving environment and community around us. Abundance manifests itself as many trees, plants, 
animals and various life forms, as well as an infinite number of stars and universes. It is the innate tendency of nature and life to manifest, 
grow and become larger.  
	Abundance is the tendency of life force to produce more and create more out of everything. 
Abundance is a clear concoction that can help you attract wealth and health into your life. 
Abundance nourishes our self-esteem and self-confidence, and helps us remain resilient in times of trouble.
	It is associated with positive thinking and generosity, with a core belief that there is enough for everyone. 
There is abundance in the Universe, and everyone is a part of it, wherever they live, and regardless of his position and circumstances. 
The world will soon have the opportunity to meet and exceed the basic needs of every man, woman and child on the planet. 
  Progress  Whether progress is seen in terms of big or small improvements, it matters a lot. However, while we continue to move towards the final goal, 
much remains to be done. For example: to make the internet accessible to everyone, many more systemic changes are needed, but progress is being made. 
	Progress is movement towards a purified, improved, or otherwise desired state. Recently, the concept of progress has been generalized to 
psychology, since it is associated with the concept of a goal, that is, progress is understood as “what is considered a means of moving towards 
the final result of a given specific goal.” Some 20th-century authors refer to The Myth of Progress, referring to the idea that 
human conditions will inevitably improve. 	
In the 20th century, romantic critics charged that progress did not automatically improve people's conditions and might somehow make them worse. 
Rogers was one of several reformers in the late 19th century who saw that America's ability to make progress could be greatly improved. 
He envisioned progress as the process of human development through the search for philosophical truths and the introduction of an era 
of material prosperity through technological progress. Marxists are vehemently opposed to capitalism, liberals are staunchly supporters of it, 
but the only concept they can agree on is progress, which asserts that people have the ability to create, improve, and change their societies 
through knowledge, science, technology, and practical experimentation. 	By "progress" we mean the combination of economic, technological, 
scientific, cultural and organizational progress that has changed our lives and raised our standard of living over the past two centuries. 
The process of progress and how things move in a positive direction of improvement is called progress. 
In particular, advancement to a higher or more developed state; development, growth. From Middle English progressie, 
from Old French progres ("to go forward"), from Latin progressus (“to move forward"), from the root participle progress 
("to go forward, to advance, to develop"), from pro- (``forward, before' ‘) + degrees (``go, go'') root participle progredi 
(``go ahead, advance, develop''), from pro- (``forward, before di'') + degrees ("walk, go" ).   Opportunity
Referring back to abundance, opportunity is created by making clear calculations of available resources and making the most of it. 	
Families in rural areas of Africa will hopefully remark that it's a great job and an opportunity to work alongside some people in the country who are 
‘’better off’’. Mpowa strongly believes in strengthening equality of opportunity all around the world, and thus being a catalyst for major development. 
	Focusing on what matters most can really make a difference in what kids learn. Accounting for the cost of opportunity costs can help individuals and organizations make better decisions. 	The purpose of calculating economic profit (and therefore opportunity cost) is to help improve business decision making by including opportunity cost, to get a clear vision of what the future may bring. To further improve business decision making, several measures of economic profit performance have been derived, such as risk-adjusted return on capital (RAROC) and economic value added (EVA), which directly include the quantification of opportunity costs to help companies manage risk and allocate resources. Accounting profits are the real costs (in real monetary terms) of businesses that are included in their balance sheets, financial statements, and income statements, and should be included as implicit costs accounted for by opportunity costs. 	When making major decisions, such as buying a home or starting a business, you are likely to carefully consider the pros and cons of your financial decision, but most day-to-day decisions are not made with a full understanding of the potential cost of the opportunity. After Coleman's 1966 Equality of Educational Opportunity report, another debate arose about whether money affects educational outcomes. The common notion of educational inequality, that it is mainly for students who come to school with insufficient skills to benefit from what the school has to offer, is still widely held because the degree of inequality in learning opportunities largely unknown. This makes it even more important that everyone around the world has internet access - to learn everything you want at your own pace.  
 Collaboration
Platform = constant collaborations   Research shows that collaboration can improve results and productivity. 
In short, collaboration makes things easier, which helps us get more done in less time. At the end of the day, 
collaboration is a skill that helps people work together, come up with new ideas, listen to each other, and learn from each other. 	
Collaboration skills enable you to successfully work with others to achieve common goals. Most work environments require collaboration, 
so collaboration skills are critical. There are various collaboration skills and communication strategies that, if developed, 
can help improve the overall effectiveness of a team. The United Nations has developed a refined framework for everyone globally to collectively 
contribute and collaborate towards reaching massive goals. Mpowa brings people together to collect ideas, funding and other resources in order to 
increase impact at a faster pace.  	Collaboration with this UN-created community is about learning from each other and sharing knowledge amongst 
teams, not about completing tasks or reaching goals with one group. Effective collaboration is essentially. the exchange of ideas, tasks, 
or skills for the purpose of developing processes, brainstorming, or completing projects.   Nature
Understanding how the natural world is presented, valued, and planned as a boon to human well-being is a disturbing challenge to my research. 
Nature-Based Solutions (NbS) involves working with nature to solve social problems, benefiting both human well-being and biodiversity. 	
Researchers are increasingly focusing on what they see as weaknesses in traditional reasoning about naturalness. In a recent study by Kevin, a lot of attention was paid to the benefits that people receive from nature, including those related to their health and well-being. A new report examines the impact of climate change on people and nature, and our ability to adapt to it. Environmental sociologist interested in the social and cultural aspects of natural resource management have been particularly involved in the development of an ecosystem approach to natural resource management, which seek to influence and shape from the social sciences and a key starting point. 	The British Ecological Society launched the People and Nature Project in recognition of the rapid growth of interdisciplinary and trans-disciplinary research on the relationship between man and nature, and that many of them touch on vital issues. 	People and Nature is a large-scale quarterly open access journal publication that explores the relationship between people and nature across all fields of research. 	Reported as part of the IPCC's Sixth Climate Science Assessment, humanity can adapt to a warming climate more easily than the natural world. The Persian Gulf will be the first to warm, but "it will become a problem in many parts of the world, including the United States," says Michael Oppenheimer. 	Regardless of the scenario, 1 billion people will be exposed to chronic flooding due to rising sea levels. Food insecurity will worsen as malnutrition rises in the global south. For example, ONeill notes, the number of people pushed into poverty in 15 years due to climate change could range from 10 million to 100 million, depending on their vulnerability and the vulnerability of their land. 

Authenticity
The word "authenticity" means the state in which something is authentic, legal, and true. Simply put, authenticity means being true to your personality, your values, and your spirit, no matter how much you are forced to act differently. Today, when people use the term "authenticity" they usually mean that they are honest and open. Their starting point is their perception that the term "authenticity" refers to what is the real, genuine or true term "authenticity". 	First, they argue that in order to understand the meaning of authenticity it is necessary to know who or what is the reference point for assessing authenticity, which can be either inside (i.e. the entity itself) or outside the entity (i.e. social category). judge. 	 In the descriptive use of authenticity, inauthenticity is simply the standard state of everyday life in which our personal relationships are mediated by others. Intellectual descriptions of abstract concepts that constitute authenticity often indicate descriptive limitations of language; in order to describe the negative space surrounding unreal states, unreal life examples illustrate states of real personality. When used in the latter sense, authenticity describes a person acting in accordance with desires, motives, ideals, or beliefs that not only belong to him (and not to others), but also expresses who he really is. 	Authenticity is more than making someone believe what they say or act in a way that is consistent with their beliefs. However, authenticity is likely to always mean different things to different people. True authenticity doesn't require you to share your values ​​with anyone because everyone can see your values ​​in the way you live. When you live with sincerity, you don’t have to worry about what you said (or didn't say), how you acted, or whether you did the right thing. 
“Be authentic with Mpowa.”

Problems and solutions

Vulnerable communities in developing nations have limited to no incentive to maintain their local ecosystem and preserve the natural environment. 
Due to extreme poverty and exclusion, pollution, environmental degradation and carbon intensive activities (wood, charcoal, kerosene burning), 
these communities  are unhealthy and dangerous places for children to grow up, with high infant mortality rates and incidence of preventable disease. 
	GHG emissions contribute to the overall carbon intensity of the South African economy, being 9th in the world overall and highest within 
the G20 group of nations in segment “Destruction of the local ecosystem” which leads to a negative spiral of neglect and despondency, 
species/wildlife depletion and unsanitary living conditions. 	Another example, when inspecting research data, is that only 7% of the population
 in Uganda has a had a sustainable form of clean water available for them. There’s a significant need for support in several African countries, 
hence our pilot projects will likely take place that region of the world. 
	Mpowa recognizes that poverty eradication, changing unsustainable and promoting sustainable patterns of consumption and production 
and protecting and managing the natural resource base of economic and social development are the overarching objectives of and essential 
requirements for sustainable development. We also reaffirm the need to achieve sustainable development by promoting sustained, 
inclusive and equitable economic growth, creating greater opportunities for all, reducing inequalities, raising basic standards of living, 
fostering equitable social development and inclusion, and promoting the integrated and sustainable management of natural resources and ecosystems 
that supports, inter alia, economic, social and human development while facilitating ecosystem conservation, regeneration and restoration 
and resilience in the face of new and emerging challenges. 	Mpowa reaffirms the importance of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,
1 as well as other international instruments relating to human rights and international law. Mpowa emphasizes the responsibilities to respect, 
protect and promote human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, without distinction of any kind as to race, color, sex, language, religion, 
political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth, disability or other status.	
Through working together with local “Heroes” and NGO’s, Mpowa has the capacity to scale its area of contribution to a large extend. 
It is prospected that several rural areas in Africa, in different countries, will start to receive support from Q3 2022 onwards. 	
By keeping the data and measurements conform to the Data Structure Definition (as defined by the UN), 
Mpowa allows its projects to be officially regarded as legitimate and impactful, to ensure contributors that their contribution will result i
nto legally verifiable impact. Mpowa’s approach of reporting and will be acquired once the technology has been funded for deployment, 
to enable Mpowa to credibly present themselves to these organizations.   A specific set of SDG indicators is selected by Mpowa, 
in terms of relevancy based on impact from projects that are currently on its agenda. Indicators are selected by applicability on and for 
the projects that are currently managed by the platform and for prioritized future projects. Project impact is driven to certain indicators and 
impact is noted and confirmed by official mathematical models.    Listed below are 17 problems, derived from statistical observations, 
by studying the United Nations Sustainability Development Goals and the issues that are addressed in the 2030 Agenda. 
NFT’s will contain the necessary metadata according to the UN DSD’s for the impact to be processed and included into reports. 





Problem 1: 
Poverty in all its forms.  The international poverty line is a threshold used to measure extreme poverty based on consumption or income levels. 
A person is considered extremely poor if his or her consumption or income level falls below the minimum level necessary to meet basic needs. 
 International poverty line is the absolute global minimum is per 2022 $3,20 (in PPP).   The indicator is produced globally using micro-level data 
on household income or consumption expenditures from nationally representative household surveys, which is reported to the World Bank’s development 
research group and/or the ILO (for working poverty). Only nationally representative surveys that contain sufficient information to produce a 
comprehensive consumption or income aggregate (including consumption or income from own production) and allow for the construction of a correctly 
weighted distribution of per capita consumption or income are used.  	
Examples of surveys include household income and expenditure surveys (HIES), living standards measurement surveys (LSMS) with employment modules, 
or labour force surveys (LFS) that collect information on household income. Such surveys also offer the benefit of allowing the employment status 
and income (or consumption expenditure) variables to be derived from the same sampled households ideally for the same long observation period.  
Poverty is basically result of resource scarcity.  National definitions of poverty vary amongst the globe.


Solution:  Social protection systems, appropriately nationally implemented for all.
