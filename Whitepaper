Mpowa Ltd Whitepaper | Version 1.0

Preface

This blockchain-based interactive SaaS platform, is contrived to stimulate society to collectively ensure global resource sufficiency and accessibility for sustainable healthy living. Aiming to serve humanity as a whole, 
on the increasingly more turbulent and polluted planet earth. Averting unnecessary illness and death is the most important reason for Mpowa’s existence,
as every human being should ideally be able to live in a healthy way. By continually increasing the Energy Flux Density, resource abundance is within reach. 
Mpowa does not agree to the general consensus of mandatory vaccination and consumption control in order to reduce emissions.  

By also empowering externally organized SDG-oriented clean-tech projects to present themselves on the platform, Mpowa facilitates the industry with a high-standard GTM opportunity, 
while also permitting low-cap / high-value projects to raise the necessary funding to succeed.
Transparency and auditability are key features of blockchain technology, which provide traceability of funds (resource allocation can be tracked from start to finish) and verifiable Proof of Impact.
Constant transparency and credibility also differentiates the SaaS platform from established competitors and well known large-scale foundations that utilize traditional banking technology. 
Mpowa’s data-driven approach is in line with UN’s DSDs to match the United Nations National Quality Assurance Frameworks Manual for Official Statistics. By utilizing blockchain technology, 
Mpowa provides an additional credibility layer to ensure data quality, transparency of set definitions and important terms and project methodology towards contributors and auditors.
